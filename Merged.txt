Keywords:
Smoking cessation
Cigarette smoking
Disability
Behaviour change theory

Rationale
Persons with physical disabilities report higher cigarette smoking rates and a lower likelihood of accessing
health services (e.g., smoking cessation services). Explicit and systematic application of behaviour change theory
may be a promising approach to addressing these inequities and developing impactful smoking cessation in­
terventions for persons with physical disabilities.
Objective: This scoping review aimed to explore how behaviour change theory and intervention components have
been used to design smoking cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities.
Methods: Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science) were systematically
searched. Smoking cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities were identified. Behaviour
change theory and intervention components, including behaviour change techniques, intervention functions,
mode of delivery, intervention source, and setting, were extracted from the included articles.
Results: Among the eleven included articles, there were nine unique smoking cessation interventions for persons
with physical disabilities. Three interventions mentioned theory, but none of these articles explicitly applied or
tested the theory. Intervention components were consistently combined to deliver pharmacotherapy and
behavioural counselling-based interventions.
Conclusion: The results of this review highlight the scarcity of theory-based smoking cessation interventions for
persons with physical disabilities. While the interventions were not theory-based, they were evidence-based and
aligned with recommendations for smoking cessation treatment (i.e., behavioural counselling plus pharmaco­
therapy). Future research should take a theory-based approach to intervention development to enhance the
likelihood that smoking cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities are effective, replicable, and
equitable.

1. Introduction
About 1.5 billion people (15% of the world’s population) report a
disability (World Health Organization (WHO), 2011). Disability is not
merely the presence of a medical condition. Instead, an individual with a
physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment experiences a
’disability’ when they encounter environmental, attitudinal, or social
barriers that limit their full participation in society (WHO, 2011).
Among individuals with disabilities in high-income countries, more than
half report a disability related to pain, mobility, or flexibility impair­
ments (i.e., physical disability) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2020;

Government of Canada, 2021). Physical disabilities include but are not
limited to spinal cord injury, Parkinson’s disease, amputations, and
arthritis. Compared to the able-bodied population, persons with physical
disabilities report lower quality of life and a greater prevalence of
chronic disease (Rimmer & Rowland, 2008). Health promotion and
behaviour change services (e.g., physical activity support, smoking
cessation advice) provide a promising approach to improving quality of
life and social participation among persons with physical disabilities
(Rimmer & Rowland, 2008). However, persons with disabilities are less
likely to access health promotion services than their able-bodied coun­
terparts due to the affordability of care, inaccessibility of health

facilities, and negative attitudes and ignorance among health pro­
fessionals (Downs et al., 2004; The Lancet, 2019). This lack of health
promotion services is inequitable and poses a significant barrier to basic
human rights (i.e., UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Dis­
abilities; UN Department of Public Information, 2006) among persons
with physical disabilities.
The field of addiction is not an exception to this trend of excluding
people with disabilities from the health promotion agenda. Improve­
ments in tobacco control policies, pharmacotherapy, and health pro­
motion interventions (e.g., behavioural counselling) have improved
smoking cessation among the general population (Hammond et al.,
2007; McIvor et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2001). Cigarette smoking
rates are reported to be 13–15% among the general population in highincome countries (US, UK, Netherlands; Office for National Statistics,
2022; Trimbos-instituut, 2021; Wang, 2018). When the smoking rates in
the above-mentioned high-income countries are disaggregated, persons
with physical disabilities report substantially higher rates (22–47%;
Courtney-Long et al, 2014; Haisma et al., 2007; Emerson, 2018; Okoro,
2018). This rate discrepancy may be partially attributable to low
engagement with conventional smoking cessation interventions (i.e.,
behavioural counselling and/or pharmacotherapy). Among a US sample
of 152 individuals with a physical disability who smoke, 57% attempted
quitting in the previous year. Less than half (48%) used some form of
pharmacotherapy, and less than 6% engaged in behavioural counselling
(Borrelli et al., 2013). Comparatively, among a sample of 884 in­
dividuals in the US who smoke, 43% attempted quitting in the previous
year. Over half used some form of pharmacotherapy, and 21% used
behavioural counselling (Hughes et al., 2009). These high smoking rates
and low treatment engagement may indicate that smoking cessation
services are either not reaching persons with physical disabilities (e.g.,
healthcare practitioners are less likely to offer advice and information on
health promotion to individuals with disabilities than to able-bodied
individuals; Iezzoni et al., 2001; Kroll et al., 2006) or may not meet
their needs (e.g., individuals with physical disabilities encounter unique
circumstances to stopping smoking that may not be addressed in con­
ventional services; Wuerstl et al., 2023). Theory-informed interventions
tailored to the needs of persons with physical disabilities are needed to
support smoking cessation among this equity-seeking group.
Systematic application of behaviour change theory may support the
development of effective smoking cessation interventions (e.g., Brown
et al., 2014; Michie et al., 2012). Specifically, among smoking cessation
interventions in the general population, application of the Theory of
Planned Behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory is suggested to result in
effective smoking cessation interventions (Lareyre et al., 2021; Villanti
et al., 2020). Behaviour change theories explain why, when, and how a
behaviour occurs and the mechanisms of action that could be targeted to
alter that behaviour (Michie & Prestwich, 2010; Michie et al., 2014;
Rothman, 2004). Additionally, systematic theory use enables a cumu­
lative science by coordinating evidence and synthesis, providing a
rationale for predictions, and giving a basis for interpreting new findings
(Hastings et al., 2020). Recent advancements in the behavioural science
field have produced a series of ontologies (i.e., systematic method for
carefully articulating the inter-relationships between classes of carefully
defined phenomena) for classifying theoretical constructs (e.g., mecha­
nisms of action) and intervention components of behavioural in­
terventions (e.g., behaviour change techniques (BCT), mode of delivery;
see Table 1 for definitions of behaviour change intervention terms)
(Larsen et al., 2016; Michie et al., 2013; Marques et al., 2020; Norris
et al., 2021). Alongside theory, ontologies enable a common language
across behaviours and interventions which may aid in understanding
why an intervention was effective or ineffective, supporting future
replication of the intervention, and identifying what theories and com­
ponents are effective in which contexts, settings, and populations
(Larsen et al., 2016).
In addition to being theory-based, interventions also need to be
informed by systematic reviews. A Cochrane review of smoking

intervention

cessation interventions recommends using a combination of behavioural
counselling and pharmacotherapy (Stead et al., 2016). However, it is
unknown whether smoking cessation interventions for persons with
physical disabilities adhere to these recommendations or whether
modifications are being made to address any unique circumstances (e.g.,
transportation barriers, pain management) encountered by persons with
physical disabilities when quitting smoking. A first step in the inter­
vention development process is to systematically review the literature to
understand theory application and intervention components (e.g., mode
of delivery, BCTs) used in smoking cessation interventions for persons
with physical disabilities (Czajkowski et al., 2015; Graham et al., 2006;
Michie et al., 2011). Scoping reviews address exploratory research
questions aimed at mapping key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps
by systematically searching, selecting, and synthesizing knowledge
(Arksey & O’Malley, 2005). As such, scoping reviews are a promising
approach for assessing theory and intervention component use in
smoking cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities.
Effective smoking cessation interventions that address the priorities of
people with physical disabilities are essential to addressing health in­
equities encountered by this population.
This scoping review aimed to explore how behaviour change theory
and intervention components were employed in the design of smoking
cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities. This
scoping review aimed to answer:
1. How is theory used to design smoking cessation interventions for
persons with physical disabilities?
2. What behaviour change techniques, intervention functions, modes
of delivery, intervention sources, and intervention settings are used in
smoking cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities?
2. Methods
2.1. Design
This review examined the number of smoking cessation in­
terventions for persons with physical disabilities and the components
underpinning them (see Table 1 for behaviour change intervention
terms and definitions). We followed the stages for conducting a scoping
review outlined by Arksey & O’Malley (2005): identifying the research
question, identifying relevant publications and selecting articles for

inclusion, extracting data, and analyzing and summarizing results.

text screening. Full-texts were independently screened for inclusion by
two researchers (KW, KT). Neither researcher was blinded to the journal
titles, study authors, or institutions. References of included articles were
also hand-searched to ensure completeness.

2.2. Search strategy
The search strategy was developed using Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) and keywords related to physical disability, smoking cessation,
and interventions. Physical disability search terms reflect the Canadian
Survey on Disability (Government of Canada, 2018) conceptualization
of physical disability as any flexibility, mobility, dexterity, or painrelated impairment that restricts full participation in society. Addi­
tionally, physical disability keywords and MeSH were informed by
previous reviews on physical disability (Martin Ginis et al., 2016; Shaw
et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2017). Smoking cessation and study design
search terms were adapted from the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group
Specialized Register (Cochrane Tobacco Addiction, n.d). The search
strategy was developed by KW, KT, SL, HG, and a health sciences
librarian.
KW performed the search on August 20th, 2019, and updated the
search on February 17th, 2023. Databases searched include MEDLINE
(OVID interface, 1948 onwards), EMBASE (OVID interface, 1980 on­
wards), CINAHL (EBSCO interface, 1982 onwards), Web of Science, and
PsycINFO (EBSCO interface). No date restrictions were applied to the
search. Grey literature was not searched to ensure feasibility. The
MEDLINE search is available on OSF and in Supplementary File 1. Once
the MEDLINE strategy was finalized, syntax and subject headings were
adapted for the other databases.

2.5. Data extraction and Analysis
Training and familiarization with the data extraction manual and
coding frameworks and ontologies were conducted before starting data
extraction to ensure consistency between researchers (KW, SL, AS, BH).
Disagreements were resolved through discussions between researchers,
and if agreement could not be reached, a third researcher (HG) was
consulted. See Table 1 for behaviour change intervention terms and
definitions (e.g., mode of delivery, intervention function).
2.5.1. Study characteristics
Study characteristics were extracted by one researcher (KW) and
checked for accuracy by a second researcher (SL). Study characteristics
included sample characteristics (number of participants, age, gender,
sex, disability type, and duration of smoking behaviour) and interven­
tion characteristics (duration of intervention, frequency of contact,
duration of contact, type of intervention, and control or comparison
group).
2.5.2. Behaviour change theory
Behaviour change theory was extracted using Michie and Prestwich’s
(2010) Theory Coding Scheme. Two researchers (KW, SL) extracted
theory independently and met after all articles had been extracted to
discuss discrepancies. If an agreement could not be reached, a third
researcher was consulted (HG). The Theory Coding Scheme includes
nineteen items used to assess whether theory was used and the degree to
which it was used to inform intervention development (e.g., participant
selection, selection of intervention techniques, intervention tailoring)
(Michie & Prestwich, 2010).

2.3. Eligibility criteria
To be included, studies must describe a smoking cessation inter­
vention (i.e., a program, service, or strategy/strategies to help people
stop cigarette smoking) for adults with physical disabilities (e.g., painrelated, dexterity, mobility, and/or flexibility disabilities). All inter­
vention study designs were considered for inclusion. Only studies that
were peer-reviewed were considered for inclusion. Studies were
excluded if they were not written in English, delivered a smoking
cessation intervention to individuals with mental illness, cognitive,
developmental, intellectual, or sensory disabilities, delivered a smoking
cessation intervention to youth with disabilities, or delivered an inter­
vention to reduce marijuana use. If studies delivered an intervention to
persons with physical disabilities and other disabilities, they were
excluded if they did not disaggregate results by disability type. Studies
were excluded if they did not report smoking cessation outcomes (e.g.,
abstinence) or their primary objective was smoking reduction rather
than smoking cessation. If a study examined smoking cessation along­
side another behaviour (e.g., reducing marijuana use, e-cigarette or
vaping cessation), they were considered for inclusion.

2.5.3. Behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action
BCTs targeting cigarette smoking behaviour were extracted articleby-article using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1
(BCTTv1) by two researchers independently (KW, BH) (Michie et al.,
2013). The researchers were certified to extract BCTs using the BCTTv1.
After each article, the two met to resolve any coding discrepancies. A
third researcher (HG) was consulted if agreement could not be reached.
BCTs were extracted only once from each study arm (i.e., intervention
arm and control arm), even if the article reported the same BCT multiple
times. Using Michie et al.’s (2018) Theory and Technique Tool, mech­
anisms of action corresponding with each extracted BCT were identified.
Only mechanisms of action conclusively linked to the extracted BCTs
were identified (Carey et al., 2019; Connell et al., 2019; Johnston et al.,
2021; Michie et al., 2018).

2.4. Screening process

2.5.4. Intervention functions, mode of delivery, intervention source, and
intervention setting
Intervention functions, modes of delivery, intervention sources, and
intervention settings (see Table 1 for definitions) were extracted articleby-article by two researchers independently (KW, AS). Intervention
functions were extracted using the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie
et al., 2014); modes of delivery were extracted using the Mode of De­
livery Ontology (Marques et al., 2021); intervention sources were
extracted using the Intervention Source Ontology (Norris et al., 2021);
and intervention settings were extracted using the Intervention Setting
Ontology (Norris et al., 2020). After each article, the two researchers
met to resolve any coding discrepancies. A third researcher (HG) was
consulted if an agreement could not be reached.

Search results were uploaded to RefWorks reference management
software, where de-duplication was performed. Titles and abstracts were
exported to Excel to review and select included articles. Reasons for
exclusion of full-texts were reported in the Excel document (see sup­
plementary file 3).
Before screening titles and abstracts, screening questions and forms
were developed by KW, KT, SL, and HG based on the exclusion and in­
clusion criteria and piloted by KW and KT to ensure reliability in
correctly excluding and including articles. Training and familiarization
of the screening protocol were conducted with all researchers before
starting the review process to ensure consistency between researchers.
Two researchers (KW, KT) independently screened titles and ab­
stracts for inclusion. Disagreements between researchers were resolved
through discussion, and if agreement could not be reached, a third
researcher was consulted (HG). Titles and abstracts whose inclusion was
identified as uncertain due to lack of information were included for full3

same intervention (Aimer et al., 2016, 2018; Aimer et al., 2017); hence,
there are nine unique interventions. Table 2 contains selected descrip­
tive information (e.g., title, objective) from the eleven articles.
The most common study designs were RCTs (k = 4; 36%) and
observational (k = 4; 36%). Studies focused on a range of physical dis­
abilities, including rheumatoid arthritis (k = 4; 36%), chronic pain (k =
4; 36%), multiple sclerosis (k = 1; 11%), spinal cord injury (k = 1; 11%),
and inflammatory rheumatic diseases (k = 1; 11%). The number of
participants ranged from 0 to 24,652. Table 3 provides sample charac­
teristics and intervention characteristics for the included studies.

Cohen’s Kappa statistic and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted Kappa
(PABAK) statistic were used to establish reliability between coders for
coding BCTs, mode of delivery, intervention source, and intervention
setting. Cohen’s Kappa considers the possibility of agreement occurring
by chance to provide a robust measure of reliability between coders but
is affected by the presence of bias between the coders and by distribu­
tions of data across the categories (prevalence) (Byrt et al., 1993; Cohen,
1968). To correct for this, PABAK assumes a fifty percent prevalence of
the category and the absence of bias (Byrt et al., 1993). Interrater reli­
ability values between 0.41 and 0.60 indicate “moderate” reliability,
values between 0.61 and 0.80 indicate “substantial” reliability, and
values between 0.81 and 1.00 indicate “almost perfect” reliability
(Landis & Koch, 1977).

3.2. Behaviour change theory
Among the nine unique interventions, three interventions mentioned
using theory. The remaining six interventions lacked information about
theory use. Naranjo et al. (2013) mentioned the Transtheoretical Model
in determining participants’ preparation phase (i.e., pre-contemplation,
contemplation, action, maintenance). No other information was pro­
vided about how the theory informed the development of the inter­
vention. Driscoll et al. (2018) described the Mutual Maintenance Model
of Pain and Smoking and used the model to select recipients for the
intervention. Bastian et al. (2021) stated that their intervention was
based on Social Cognitive Theory and identified the construct of
self-efficacy as a predictor of smoking cessation behaviour.

3. Results
3.1. Literature search & descriptive information
Systematic searches of the five aforementioned databases identified
8526 citations and 17 citations from hand-searching references. After
de-duplication, 6328 citations were screened against inclusion criteria,
and 84 advanced to full-text review. Eleven articles satisfied all inclusion
criteria following full-text review (Fig. 1). Three articles report on the

3.3. Behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action
A total of 84 BCTs (comprised of 25 unique BCTs) were extracted
from the included articles. There were 66 BCTs (25 unique BCTs)
extracted from the intervention arms and 18 BCTs (8 unique BCTs) from
the control arms. Interventions reported an average of 7.3 BCTs, ranging
from zero to twelve. The most commonly coded BCTs were goal setting
(behaviour) (k = 5; 56%), social support (unspecified) (k = 7; 78%), in­
formation about health consequences (k = 5; 56%), credible source (k = 6;
67%), pharmacological support (k = 7; 78%), and adding objects to the
environment (k = 5; 56%). Interrater reliability was substantial to almost
perfect (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.56 ± 0.16; PABAK = 0.88 ± 0.07).
The 25 unique BCTs were linked to 19 mechanisms of action. In­
terventions targeted an average of 8.75 mechanisms of action, ranging

recipient and vice versa). Interrater reliability was substantial to almost
perfect (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.77 ± 0.14; PABAK = 0.89 ± 0.07).

3.4. Intervention functions

A total of 35 intervention sources (comprised of 15 unique inter­
vention sources) were extracted from the included articles. There were
29 intervention sources extracted from the intervention arms and six
from the control arms. Interventions used, on average, 3.2 intervention
sources, ranging from zero to seven. The most commonly coded inter­
vention sources were nursing professional (k = 4; 44%), specialist
medical practitioner (k = 3; 33%), community health worker (k = 3;
33%), and voluntary sector organization (k = 3; 33%). Interrater reli­
ability was substantial to almost perfect (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.60 ± 0.29;
PABAK = 0.97 ± 0.03).

3.6. Intervention sources

A total of 32 intervention functions (comprised of five unique
intervention functions) were extracted from the included articles. There
were 22 intervention functions extracted from the intervention arms and
10 from the control arms. Interventions used an average of 2.4 inter­
vention functions, ranging from one to three. The five unique inter­
vention functions included education (k = 8; 88%), enablement (k = 8;
88%), training (k = 3; 33%), persuasion (k = 2; 22%), and restriction (k
= 1; 14%). Interrater reliability was substantial (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.74
± 0.18; PABAK = 0.80 ± 0.13).

3.7. Intervention settings

3.5. Mode of delivery

A total of 20 intervention settings (comprised of 12 unique inter­
vention settings) were extracted from the included articles. In­
terventions used, on average, 2.2 intervention settings, ranging from
zero to five. The most commonly coded intervention settings were
country of intervention (k = 5; 56%), within country location (k = 3;
33%), healthcare facility (k = 2; 22%), and hospital outpatient clinic
facility (k = 2; 22%). Interrater reliability was substantial to almost
perfect (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.53 ± 0.36; PABAK = 0.96 ± 0.03).

A total of 113 modes of delivery (comprised of 22 unique modes of
delivery) were extracted from the included articles. There were 86
modes of delivery extracted from the intervention arms and 27 from the
control arms. Interventions reported an average of 12.5 modes of de­
livery, ranging from five to fourteen. The most commonly coded modes
of delivery were somatic (k = 8; 89%), audio calls (k = 6; 67%), and at-adistance human interactional (k = 6; 67%). Most of the interventions
were individual-based (k = 8; 89%). Two interventions also included a
group-based portion. Eight interventions (89%) included interactional
components (i.e., causal influence from the intervention source to the

3.8. Intervention approach
The interventions used a range of intervention components, but
generally, these components were combined to deliver pharmaco­
therapy and counselling-based interventions. Eight interventions
advised the use of pharmacotherapy (Aimer et al., 2016, 2018; Bastian
et al., 2021; Ciccolo et al., 2012; Driscoll et al., 2018; Hooten et al.,
2013; Lane et al., 2016; Laugesen et al., 2022; Naranjo et al., 2013;
Aimer et al., 2017), and Four provided some form of pharmacotherapy
to the participants (corresponding to the intervention function of ena­
blement and the BCT pharmacological support) (Aimer et al., 2016, 2018;
Ciccolo et al., 2012; Lane et al., 2016; Naranjo et al., 2013; Aimer et al.,
2017). Eight interventions used audio calls or face-to-face modes of
delivery to provide behavioural counselling (corresponding to the
intervention function of education and the BCTs social support (unspeci­
fied) and information about health consequences) (Aimer et al., 2016,
2018; Bastian et al., 2021; Driscoll et al., 2018; Hooten et al., 2013; Kaye
et al., 2012; Lane et al., 2016; Laugesen et al., 2022; Naranjo et al., 2013;
Aimer et al., 2017). Seven interventions used a combination of phar­
macotherapy and behavioural counselling (Aimer et al., 2016, 2018;
Bastian et al., 2021; Driscoll et al., 2018; Hooten et al., 2013; Lane et al.,
2016; Laugesen et al., 2022; Naranjo et al., 2013; Aimer et al., 2017),
while the other two interventions used only one of these approaches
(Ciccolo et al., 2012; Kaye et al., 2012).

4. Discussion
This scoping review explored behaviour change theory application
and intervention component use in smoking cessation interventions for
persons with physical disabilities. Our search revealed few smoking
cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities. Among the
nine unique interventions, three interventions mentioned theory in their
8

K.R. Wuerstl et al.

Addictive Behaviors 145 (2023) 107762

intervention descriptions. Limited information about how the theory
was applied to inform the development and testing of the intervention
could be extracted. Additionally, 25 unique BCTs corresponding to 19
mechanisms of action were extracted. Based on the extracted interven­
tion components, the interventions broadly delivered behavioural
counselling and pharmacotherapy, aligning with smoking cessation
treatment recommendations (Stead et al., 2016).
Our search highlighted the scarcity of smoking cessation in­
terventions for persons with physical disabilities. The dearth of health
promotion research for persons with physical disabilities is a widespread
issue across the health and medical field (Martin Ginis et al., 2021; The
Lancet, 2019). Between 1999 and 2019, less than 1% of published ar­
ticles in the five highest-impact medical journals addressed the health of
people with disabilities (Martin Ginis et al., 2021). Our findings high­
light the urgent need for smoking cessation research for persons with
physical disabilities to reduce health inequities among this population.
While there is a need for more smoking cessation research for persons
with physical disabilities, it is paramount that this research is highquality and theory-based. Among the nine unique interventions, three
referenced theory, but none of these interventions explicitly applied or
tested the theory. Interventions that explicitly apply theory tend to yield
larger effect sizes than interventions that mention theory or do not apply
theory (Prestwich et al., 2014; Webb et al., 2010). However, some
research suggests that theory-based interventions are no more effective
than non-theory based (Prestwich et al., 2014). Systematic theory use
enables us to understand why an intervention succeeded or failed,
replicate successful interventions, and optimize ineffective interventions
which may lead to a meaningful return on time, money, and efforts
(Michie & Prestwich, 2010; Rothman, 2004).
Smoking cessation interventions that systematically applied Social
Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Planned Behaviour are suggested to
be effective in changing smoking behaviour (Lareyre et al., 2021; Vil­
lanti et al., 2020). Within our review, only Bastian et al. (2021) used a
theory aligned with smoking cessation literature. Bastian et al. (2021)
state their intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory, and identify
self-efficacy as a predictor of smoking cessation behaviour. However, it
was unclear how the theory was used to develop the intervention or how
the intervention targeted the construct of self-efficacy. Future smoking
cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities should
explicitly and systematically apply Social Cognitive Theory or the The­
ory of Planned Behaviour to maximize understanding of the interven­
tion, potential effectiveness, and replication.
A systematic review and meta-regression exploring BCT effectiveness
in smoking cessation interventions found three BCTs predicted higher
smoking cessation in person-delivered interventions: prompting commit­
ment, social reward, and identity associated with changed behaviour (Black
et al., 2020). Notably, Black et al. (2020) found that BCT effects did not
vary across populations, suggesting these three BCTs may effectively
support smoking cessation among persons with physical disabilities.
Within our review, social reward and identity associated with changed
behaviour were each extracted once (Hooten et al., 2013; Naranjo et al.,
2013) and prompting commitment was never extracted. While the in­
terventions identified in this review align with smoking cessation
treatment recommendations (i.e., behavioural counselling plus phar­
macotherapy; Stead et al., 2016), they appear to lack three potentially
critical BCTs (prompting commitment, social reward, identity associated
with changed behaviour). Future smoking cessation interventions for
persons with physical disabilities should include these three BCTs to
maximize the potential effectiveness of the intervention.

study was the exclusion of grey literature to ensure feasibility, which
may mean we missed interventions not published in academic journals.
Community-based organizations that support people with physical dis­
abilities may provide tailored resources, which could include disabilityspecific smoking cessation interventions. A third limitation of this study
was our lack of stakeholder involvement. Levac et al. (2010) outlined an
extension to Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) stages for conducting a
scoping review that adds stakeholder engagement as an additional stage.
While this review was not conducted using a partnership approach (e.g.,
integrated knowledge translation), the questions being answered were
informed by the disability community through discussions with a
representative of a community-based organization. This review is part of
a larger project to co-develop a smoking cessation intervention for
persons with spinal cord injury. The disability community will be
meaningfully engaged in applying these findings to inform the codevelopment of a smoking cessation intervention for persons with spi­
nal cord injury. Another limitation of this study was our ability to assess
the true extent of theory and BCT use. We can only extract what authors
have reported in their studies, which may result in underestimating
theory and BCT use. All the interventions identified in this review used
gold-standard treatments of behaviour counselling, pharmacotherapy,
or a combination of the two. As such, these treatments may be implicitly
informed by theory. Finally, we excluded studies that delivered smoking
cessation interventions to physical disabilities and other disabilities if
they did not disaggregate smoking cessation outcomes by disability
type. A future scoping review will focus on treatment outcomes of the
studies included in this review. As such, we included disaggregating
disability results as an inclusion criterion to ensure we could draw ac­
curate conclusions about smoking cessation among people with physical
disabilities and that other disability data did not confound these con­
clusions. We acknowledge that as a result of excluding these studies, we
may have missed important information about theory and BCT use.
There were also several strengths. Our use of theoretical frameworks
and ontologies to code data was a strength of this review. Frameworks
and ontologies provide a common language through which the findings
of this review can be compared across behaviours, populations, and
contexts and ultimately contribute to advancing behavioural science
(Michie & Prestwich, 2010). Furthermore, the use of frameworks and
ontologies may support future researchers in developing effective
smoking cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities.
Second, our search strategy was co-developed with a health sciences
librarian, reducing the likelihood of missing relevant articles.
4.2. Future directions
Future research that takes a theory-based approach is needed to
comprehensively understand the theoretical constructs and mechanisms
of action underpinning persons with physical disabilities’ smoking
cessation behaviour. A comprehensive empirical foundation grounded
in behaviour change theory will support future researchers in taking a
theory-based approach to designing and testing smoking cessation in­
terventions, which may ultimately lead to more effective, equitable, and
replicable interventions.
This review identified how theory, BCTs, and delivery components
are being applied to smoking cessation interventions for persons with
physical disabilities. Broadly, the interventions identified in this review
delivered the gold standard of pharmacotherapy and/or behavioural
counselling. Future research is needed to understand how these in­
terventions are being tailored and modified to address the various bar­
riers to engaging with conventional smoking cessation services (e.g.,
transportation, negative and stigmatizing attitudes, inaccessible envi­
ronments) encountered by people with physical disabilities.

4.1. Limitations and strengths
This review has a few limitations that should be acknowledged. First,
this review was not pre-registered on an open-science platform such as
PROSPERO or OSF. While this review was not registered, our protocol
was uploaded to OSF in November 2019. A second limitation of this

cessation interventions for persons with physical disabilities and the
need for theory-based addiction research for persons with physical dis­
abilities. Interventions were broadly evidence-based but not theorybased, which may limit future endeavours to replicate or adapt in­
terventions to other contexts, populations, and settings. Theory-based
smoking cessation interventions that address the priorities of persons
with physical disabilities are needed to rectify health inequities.

Only a small minority of all attempts to stop smoking are successful, especially among smokers who are
heavy drinkers and those with an alcohol use disorder. The current systematic review focuses on the
negative effects of alcohol use, either before or during attempts to quit smoking, on the success rate of
these attempt(s) in alcohol-drinking tobacco smokers. We conducted a systematic review of naturalistic
and experimental studies, which included at least 40 tobacco smokers with a recorded drinking status
(non-drinking, heavy drinking, alcohol use disorder) and a clearly documented change in alcohol consumption. We could not conduct a meta-analysis and, thus, used consistency across studies to draw
conclusions. The evidence presented here shows that alcohol use is associated with lower rates of success
in quitting smoking in 20 out of 27 studies. This includes both lapses and relapses. Similarly, in 19 out of
20 long-term follow-up studies, the duration of smoking abstinence was shorter among persons with
higher alcohol consumption. Finally, 12 out of 13 experimental studies showed that exposure of smokers
to alcohol cues or to drinking of alcohol induce a strong propensity to smoke. It is, therefore, recommended for smokers who drink alcohol and who intend to quit smoking to use an integrated approach,
i.e., to stop or substantially reduce their alcohol consumption before and/or during their attempt to quit
smoking.

Introduction
Predictors of failure or success in smoking cessation
About two-thirds of current smokers want to quit smoking and
more than half of them make a quit attempt each year (Babb,
Malarcher, Schauer, Asman, & Jamal, 2017). Still, only about 6%
are successful (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
2011; World Health Organization (WHO), 2022), and less than
10% remain abstinent for at least 6e12 months (Babb et al., 2017).
Most smokers need several attempts before achieving long-term
abstinence (Borland, Partos, Yong, Cummings, & Hyland, 2012).
On average, a smoker makes 30 or more quit attempts before being
successful on the long term (Chaiton et al., 2016), frequently due to
isolated incidents of smoking, known as lapses, often resulting in
full relapse to smoking (United States Department of Health and

Human Services, 2020). These ﬁndings indicate that most smoking cessation attempts end in failure.
A wide variety of factors, like severity of nicotine dependence,
history of smoking, and awareness of smoking-related health risks,
predicts success or failure in attempts to quit smoking (Burling &
Burling, 2003; Kalman et al., 2004; Patten, Martin, Calfas, Lento,
& Wolter, 2001).
Concurrent use of tobacco and alcohol
Alcohol use and tobacco smoking are highly prevalent and are
often co-used. Globally, adult smoking prevalence in 2020 was
32.6% and 6.5% among men and women, respectively; 1.18 billion
people regularly smoke tobacco (Dai, Gakidou, & Lopez, 2022;
World Health Organization (WHO), 2018), and an estimated 2.3
billion people (around 30%) were current drinkers (World Health
Organization (WHO), 2018). According to the 2012e2013 NESARC
data, the year's prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and tobacco use disorder (TUD) in the United States was 13.9% (Grant
et al., 2015) and 20.0% (Chou et al., 2016), respectively.
The concurrent use of tobacco and alcohol has been well

& Jarvik, 1985; Piasecki, McCarthy, Fiore, & Baker, 2008; Piasecki,
Wood, Shiffman, Sher, & Heath, 2012). Compared to non-smokers,
smokers drink alcohol more frequently (Harrison, Hinson, &
McKee, 2009; Krukowski, Solomon, & Naud, 2005; Reed, Wang,
Shillington, Clapp, & Lange, 2007) and more heavily (Anthony &

to the risk of false negative ﬁndings (type II errors), and c) reviews
or case reports.
Evaluation of the data
The following outcome variables were used to assess the effects
at follow-up: smoking quit rate, smoking lapse and relapse rates,
proportion of relapsers vs. sustained quitters, and self-reported
temptation and rates of slip-ups to smoke. The selection of
eligible studies was performed by the authors in two rounds, ﬁrst
round by JvA and WvdB, and disagreements discussed in a second
round: 1) screening of the abstracts using the inclusion and
exclusion criteria, followed by 2) evaluation of the full text of articles, selected in round one, for eligibility to be included in the
current review.

Rationale of this study
The well-documented co-use of tobacco and alcohol implies a
considerable health risk because this combination severely hampers the ability of people dependent on these substances to stop
their use. In their review from 2006, Hughes and Kalman (2006)
compared smoking cessation success among smokers with current, past, or lifetime alcohol problems versus smokers with no
alcohol problems. To their own surprise, they found that smokers
with past, but no current alcohol problems were just as able to quit
on a given attempt as smokers who never had an alcohol problem.
Meanwhile, it seems that alcohol consumption before or during the
attempts is one of the most important predictors of failed attempts
(Dereﬁnko, Salgado García, & Sumrok, 2018). However, no systematic review is available about the effect of drinking on the
success or failure of smoking cessation. Therefore, the current review provides data on the interference of alcohol use with smoking
cessation attempts and includes ﬁndings observed in daily smokers
and moderate to heavy drinkers from the general population up to
2022. The purpose of the present systematic review is to outline
and propose a simple approach to increase success in smoking
cessation that can be of help in routine clinical consultation.

Results
A total of 1549 publications were identiﬁed from the initial
search after removal of duplicates, and 48 of these studies were
ﬁnally included in this review. Using the reference lists of these
studies, 12 additional eligible studies were identiﬁed and included.
The ﬁnal sample, therefore, consisted of 60 studies, including
405,361 subjects. Fig. 1 shows the PRISMA ﬂow chart for the
identiﬁcation, screening, and inclusion of the studies.
Three different types of eligible studies could be identiﬁed: a) 20
studies about the effects of alcohol use on smoking cessation in
naturalistic follow-up (FU) studies (Table 1), b) 27 studies about the
effects of alcohol use during attempts to quit smoking on relapse
and lapse to smoking (Table 2), and c) 13 studies about the effect of
exposure to alcohol on smoking urges/craving, and about the effects of prior alcohol use during attempts to quit smoking on expectancy (before stopping) to successfully stop smoking (Table S1).

Methods
The systematic review concerning the effect of alcohol use on
tobacco smoking status and/or smoking cessation used the PRISMA
protocol and was performed on August 19th, 2022, without backward date limitation. Tobacco smoking comprises all variants of
tobacco daily smoked: cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and pipes.
Eligible studies were retrieved from PsycInfo and PubMed and most
recent publications, i.e., those ‘in process’ were retrieved by adding
the term “NOT medline” to the search string. The following search
string was used: (recurrence OR relapse[tiab] OR quit*[tiab]) AND
(“Smoking Cessation"[MeSH Terms] OR "smoking"[MeSH Terms]
OR smoker*[tiab]) AND (“Alcohol Drinking"[MeSH Terms] OR
"alcohol"[Title/Abstract] OR drink*[tiab]) NOT review[pt]. See
Supplement for the PRISMA checklist.

Effects of alcohol use on smoking cessation in naturalistic follow-up
studies
Table 1 depicts the results of 20 studies about the effects of
alcohol use on smoking cessation in naturalistic follow-up studies
(N ¼ 396,809 subjects in total), of which 19 studies consistently
showed that prior alcohol consumption was related to higher rates
of lapse and relapse in both dependent and non-daily smokers,
with the level of prior alcohol consumption being inversely associated with the smoking abstinence rate at follow-up. The only
exception was the study of Toll and co-workers (Toll et al., 2012),
who failed to demonstrate a relationship between level of alcohol
consumption and smoking quit rate. Furthermore, smokers with
AUD or a substance use disorder (SUD) showed lower smoking quit
rates when alcohol use was continued (Weinberger, Gbedemah, &
Goodwin, 2017), and they were less likely to have stopped smoking than those without a diagnosis of AUD or drug use disorder
(DUD) (Weinberger, Pilver, Hoff, Mazure, & McKee, 2013). However,
in two of the 19 studies the effect was not shown in females. In the
study of Sorlie and Kannel (Sorlie & Kannel, 1990), consumption of
alcohol (>1 drink/day) did not decrease smoking abstinence rates
in women, and in the study of Agudo and co-workers (Agudo et al.,
2004), increased drinking was not signiﬁcantly related (p ¼ .26) to
lower smoking cessation among women.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to
obtain optimal internal validity, naturalistic studies to obtain
optimal external validity, and experimental laboratory studies to
obtain a better insight into possible mechanisms of action, thus
supporting internal validity. Other inclusion criteria: studies were
eligible if they recorded both drinking status (non-drinking, heavy
drinking, AUD) and changes in alcohol consumption by tobacco
smokers, irrespective of whether smoking cessation was the aim of
the study. Exclusion criteria were: a) studies performed in smokers
with comorbid other substance use disorders (except AUD) and/or

naltrexone condition, but this effect was not signiﬁcant (Kahler
et al., 2017). In the second study, recent drinking was initially
associated with smoking lapse, but not at the long term (Day 25)
(Dermody & Shiffman, 2020). In the remaining three studies, no
effect of alcohol consumption on smoking lapse was observed.

Effect of alcohol use on relapse and lapse to smoking
Drinking during quit attempts was an important reason for
smoking lapse and relapse. Table 2 (27 studies; two studies reported on the same sample; 7171 subjects in total) summarizes the
effects of alcohol use during a smoking cessation attempt on the
outcome of smoking cessation. Table 2A summarizes the results of
14 studies with ‘smoking relapse’ as endpoint. Eleven of the 14
studies show that prior alcohol use was associated with a smoking
relapse during follow-up. In addition, the amount of alcohol consumption was associated with smoking relapse, e.g., heavy alcohol
consumption (5 drinks/day) was associated with the doubling of
the risk for smoking relapse (Krall, Garvey, & Garcia, 2002). The
remaining three studies showed no or only a weak effect of alcohol
use on smoking relapse (Gnys et al., 1996; Lisha, Carmody,
Humﬂeet, & Delucchi, 2014; Shiffman et al., 1996; Stahre et al.,
2013), which may be due to speciﬁc differences in study design,
such as deﬁning quitting as ceasing smoking for >1 day (Lisha et al.,
20 199614), use of African American light smokers (Stahre et al.,
2013), and a short follow-up (at least one day) (Shiffman et al.,
1996).
Table 2B depicts the results of 13 studies with endpoint ‘lapse to
smoking’, and shows that compared to light or no drinking, heavy
drinking was associated with a greater risk of a lapse to smoking in
eight of the 13 studies. Two of the 13 studies showed borderline,
but insigniﬁcant effects (Dermody & Shiffman, 2020; Kahler et al.,
2017). The ﬁrst study, an RCT on naltrexone for smoking cessation
in heavy-drinking smokers, showed that 34% of all smoking lapses
occurred when participants were drinking, and that alcoholinvolved lapse to smoking was reduced by a factor of 2 in the

Association between alcohol use and smoking urges/craving and
expectancy to successfully stop smoking
Table S1 (see Supplement) summarizes a) the association between alcohol use and smoking urges and smoking under laboratory conditions and b) studies about the effects of alcohol exposure
on expectancies to successfully stop smoking (13 studies: 2142
subjects). The results consistently show that, in both men and
women, alcohol consumption was associated with increased
smoking urges/craving and smoking under laboratory conditions,
though the level of statistical signiﬁcance of the study of Kahler and
co-workers (Kahler et al., 2014) is not known. For instance, smokers
who drink even at moderate levels were less able to resist smoking
after consuming alcohol, relative to a placebo beverage (McKee,
Krishnan-Sarin, Shi, Mase, & O'Malley, 2006). Interestingly, both
in daily and non-daily smokers, alcohol use increased selfadministration of cigarettes (Barrett, Campbell, Roach, Stewart, &
Darredeau, 2013). Similarly, craving/urges and temptations to
smoke were induced by alcohol use during quit attempts (Kahler
et al., 2017; Lam et al., 2014; Shiffman et al., 2020).
With respect to expectancies for a successful quit attempt,
baseline alcohol use was signiﬁcantly associated with various barriers to cessation, like stressors and feelings less in control of moods
(Britton et al., 2021). Interestingly, higher baseline alcohol

2015), and alcohol consumption level at baseline had a dosedependent inverse association with the duration of smoking
abstinence (McClure, Wetter, de Moor, Cinciripini, & Gritz, 2002).
Indeed, moderate drinkers, and less so abstainers from alcohol,
showed lower relapse rates than drinkers at 12 weeks’ follow-up
(Leeman et al., 2008).
It is generally known that quitting smoking goes along with
considerable psychological stress, arousal, and negative feelings
due to craving. According to the Tension Reduction Theory (Cappell
& Greeley, 1987), alcohol may reduce arousal/tension, which at
least partly explains why smokers drink more alcohol during
smoking cessation attempts. In addition, women are in general
more sensitive to stress and negative stimuli, which might at least
partly explain why women have more difﬁculty achieving longterm abstinence than men (Smith, Bessette, Weinberger, Sheffer,
& McKee, 2016). A variety of behavioral and psychological traits
have been suggested to account for this difference, like fear of postcessation weight gain, negative affect from not smoking, need for
social support, and the presence of depression and anxiety (Gritz,
Nielsen, & Brooks, 1996; Reynoso, Susabda, & Cepeda-Benito,
2005). As such, women may be at increased risk to use alcohol
during smoking cessation attempts. To circumvent this reﬂex, but
also to neutralize the adverse effect of drinking on smoking
cessation, one may consider the feasibility of an integrated smoking
and alcohol intervention to simultaneously reduce alcohol and
tobacco use. Several studies have shown that individuals who
received such an integrated intervention showed better outcomes
compared to treatments addressing either tobacco or alcohol use
alone (Ames, Pokorny, Schroeder, Tan, & Werch, 2014; Kahler,
Metrik, et al., 2008; Toll et al., 2015). For instance, smoking cessation treatment, which included a brief alcohol intervention to increase the motivation to reduce alcohol consumption, resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase over 26 weeks in smoking abstinence
compared with standard cessation treatment (aOR ¼ 1.56; 95% CI:
1.01e2.43) (Kahler, Metrick, et al., 2008). Similarly, an integrated
smoking and alcohol intervention in drinking smokers that
included calling a quitline for counseling resulted in signiﬁcantly
higher smoking abstinence rates at 7 months (13.5%) compared to
standard quitline counseling (10.3%; OR ¼ 1.37; 95% CI: 1.04e1.80,
p ¼ 0.03) (Toll et al., 2015). Others also found that an integrated
smoking and alcohol intervention resulted in greater cigarette
smoking abstinence at 24 weeks follow-up compared to nicotine
patch therapy alone (23% vs. 11%) (Ames et al., 2014), though
ndez et al., 2017) could not conﬁrm
another study (Correa-Ferna
this observation. Some alcohol-dependent individuals may still
prefer sequential treatment because simultaneous treatment can
negatively impact alcohol use outcomes. However, the literature is
not conclusive (Kodl, Fu, & Joseph, 2006), and outcome appeared to
depend on ethnic background, i.e., alcohol abstinence rate was
consistently lower in the concurrent group than the delayed group

consumption was associated with greater conﬁdence in the success
of quit attempts (Britton et al., 2021). Another study among married
couples about their expectancies for success in future attempts to
quit smoking, showed that the highest risks of failure perceived
were associated with having a spouse who smokes and who is a
heavy drinker (>1 time/week) (Dollar, Homish, Kozlowski, &
Leonard, 2009).
Discussion
Current data obtained in naturalistic follow-up studies on
smoking cessation (Table 1) show that alcohol consumption during
a quit smoking attempt negatively impacts the success rate. The
results of the studies about the effects of alcohol use on relapse and
lapse to smoking (Table 2) provide the rationale for the lower quit
smoking rate due to alcohol consumption during smoking cessation attempts. In addition, this lower quit smoking rate due to
alcohol consumption is explained by the studies showing that
exposure of smokers to alcohol or alcohol cues induced a strong
propensity to smoke (cf. Table S1).
The higher smoking relapse risk of heavy drinkers has been
claimed to result from engaging in a pervasive pattern of drinking
behavior (King, de Wit, McNamara, & Cao, 2011) and a heightened
stimulatory response to alcohol that may be predictive of increased
cigarette craving (Epstein, Sher, Young, & King, 2007). Even
smokers who drink at moderate levels were less able to resist
smoking after consuming alcohol, relative to a placebo beverage
(McKee et al., 2006). Alcohol consumption also increased the subjective rewarding effects of nicotine, including self-reported pleasure and satisfaction from smoking and relief of craving for
cigarettes (Harrison et al., 2009; Rose et al., 2004), and hence
negatively affects smoking relapse (Lisha et al., 2014). In contrast,
the tendency to start drinking, e.g., after having lit a cigarette early
in the morning, is known to be much weaker, indicating that the
interaction between the two behaviors is not reciprocal. Though
alcohol use clearly has a negative impact on the success of smoking
cessation attempts, this does not imply that individuals with AUD
are not able to quit smoking, considering the successful quit
smoking reports in this group (Carmody et al., 2012; Hughes &
Kalman, 2006; Hurt et al., 2018; Kalman et al., 2011; Zawertailo,
Ivanova, Ng, Le Foll, & Selby, 2020). In addition, Hughes and
Kalman (2006) showed that smokers with past alcohol problems
were just as able to quit on a given attempt as smokers with no
alcohol problems. On the other hand, they observed that smokers
with current or past alcohol problems appeared to be less likely to
quit smoking in their lifetime, which conﬁrms our ﬁnding that a
higher level of alcohol use is associated with a lower rate of
smoking cessation.
Alcohol abstainers and light drinkers tried more often to quit
smoking than heavy drinkers (Jiang, Gonzalez, Ling, & Glantz,

among Caucasians, but not among African Americans (Fu et al.,
2008). A meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials of concurrent treatment for tobacco and other substances provided no
evidence for lower long-term smoking abstinence rates compared
to single substance interventions (Prochaska, Delucchi, & Hall,
2004).
With respect to clinical consultation, cognitive behavior therapy
(Lancaster & Stead, 2000) and/or nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT), bupropion, and varenicline (Cahill, Stevens, Perera, &
Lancaster, 2013) are proven effective as quitting aids, with NRTs,
for instance, increasing the rate of quitting by 50%e60%
(Hartmann-Boyce, Chepkin, Ye, Bullen, & Lancaster, 2018). However, high drinking rate at baseline or drinking during smoking
cessation may impair the success rate of the stop smoking attempt.
Therefore, if a history of current AUD is present, a referral to a
specialist center may be recommended, because this category of
smokers performs poorly in non-specialist smoking cessation
programs (Breslau, Peterson, Schultz, Andreski, & Chilcoat, 1996;
~ oz, Sees, Reus, & Hall, 1999; Hurt et al., 1994). As an

alternative, an integrated treatment (aimed at the reduction of both
alcohol and tobacco) could be offered to heavy drinking smokers.
Based on the current ﬁndings, it is recommended for smokers
who drink alcohol and who intend to quit smoking to use an integrated approach, i.e., to stop or substantially reduce their alcohol
consumption before and/or during their attempt to quit smoking.

review. Moreover, the studies on the effect of drinking status on
smoking cessation outcome were all based on group means, while
monitoring the effect at an individual level would be more valuable
and appropriate, considering the inter-individual variation within
the samples. In addition, gender-related barriers to smoking
cessation are not clear and should be further studied in future
research.
On the other hand, despite the large differences in terms of
design, sample composition and selection, and outcome measures,
all studies came to the same conclusion: alcohol use during
smoking cessation has in general a negative impact on quit attempts and drinking prior to smoking cessation is a negative predictor of successful cessation attempts. Still, due to the large
methodological differences across the studies, no meta-analysis
and quality ratings of the studies could be performed. For
instance, a large variety of factors, including age, gender, level of
education, smoking rate, and motivation, may have an impact on
the success rate. However, many of these predictors cannot be
changed, whereas drinking levels can potentially be changed, and
the success of smoking cessation attempts can thus be improved.

Strengths and limitations

Funding

A major methodological limitation of the current review is that
we presented data from studies with very different designs and
sample sizes and with different ways to estimate the inﬂuence of
alcohol use on smoking cessation outcomes. For a proper evaluation of the association between alcohol use and success of smoking
cessation, RCTs with a pre-stratiﬁcation for drinking status are
needed. Unfortunately, no such studies were available for this

This systematic review aims to characterize the utility of machine learning to identify the predictors of smoking
cessation outcomes and identify the machine learning methods applied in this area. In the current study, multiple searches occurred through December 9, 2022 in MEDLINE, Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation
Index, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, APA PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the
IEEE Xplore were performed. Inclusion criteria included various machine learning techniques, studies reporting
cigarette smoking cessation outcomes (smoking status and the number of cigarettes), and various experimental
designs (e.g., cross-sectional and longitudinal). Predictors of smoking cessation outcomes were assessed, including behavioral markers, biomarkers, and other predictors. Our systematic review identiﬁed 12 papers ﬁtting our
inclusion criteria. In this review, we identiﬁed gaps in knowledge and innovation opportunities for machine
learning research in the ﬁeld of smoking cessation.

1. Introduction
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in
the United States (US), contributing to approximately a half million
deaths annually, including nearly 30% of all cancer deaths [1,2]. These
deaths total more than all the deaths attributable to alcohol, illicit drug
use, homicide, AIDS, and suicide combined [2]. Unsurprisingly, smoking cigarettes causes substantial health and loss-of-productivity costs,
exceeding 300 billion US dollars annually. Reducing cigarette smoking
can decrease mortality and morbidity and improve public health.
Fortunately, most individuals who smoke cigarettes desire to quit,
and eﬃcacious treatments for smoking cessation are available. These
treatments, such as nicotine replacement, bupropion, and behavioral
therapies, produce better cessation rates than control or placebo treatments [3]. However, these treatments still leave considerable room for
improvement. For example, individuals who smoke, when completing
the highest intensity evidence-based treatments in highly controlled
conditions, relapse at a rate of 70% within 6 months [4,5]. Thus, identifying predictors of cessation may facilitate patient-treatment matching
and improve treatment outcomes.

∗

One of the approaches used to identify predictors of smoking cessation is machine learning. Machine learning is a subﬁeld of artiﬁcial
intelligence that “gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed” [6]. Machine learning approaches fall under
the general categories of supervised, ﬁtting a model to data that have
been labeled through experimental measurements or assignments [7],
and unsupervised learning, ﬁnding patterns in unlabeled data [7]; note
that hybrid approaches such as semi-supervised learning seek to capitalize on the beneﬁts of both supervised and unsupervised learning (see
Review [8] for more details). In general, these algorithms use sample
data sets to build and train a model and then test that model on novel
samples.
While the number of machine learning applications to health behaviors has increased, supporting several reviews (e.g.,[10,11]), the reviews
of machine learning approaches addressing substance and tobacco use
have been very limited. For example, an overview of machine learning in addiction research found considerable heterogeneity in predicting current substance use [12] and identiﬁed insuﬃcient data or limited
validation measures as contributors. Another example conducted a systematic review of machine learning approaches to alcohol use disorder

and found that most studies had a moderate to high risk of bias resulting
from missing data or lack of external validation [13]. Most relevant to
the current review, a scoping review was recently conducted of tobacco
research that illustrated the diversity of applications of machine learning (e.g., content analysis of tobacco on social media, smoking status
classiﬁcation, and tobacco-related outcome prediction) and concluded
that machine learning was a powerful tool that could advance research
and policy addressing tobacco control [14].
This systematic review aims to characterize the use and ability of
machine learning techniques to identify the predictors of smoking cessation outcomes. In this review, we identiﬁed gaps in knowledge and
innovation opportunities for machine learning research in the ﬁeld of
smoking cessation.

2.1. Search strategies
The following databases were searched for manuscripts published
before December 9, 2022: PubMed MEDLINE, Science Citation Index,
Social Science Citation Index, CINAHL Plus, APA PsycINFO, PubMed,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the IEEE Xplore.
The search utilized full text, English language, and peer-reviewed ﬁlters
to identify titles on smoking cessation and machine learning. Speciﬁcally, the terms searched were: ((“machine learning” OR “reinforcement
learning” OR “deep learning” OR “text mining”) AND (smoking OR tobacco OR nicotine∗ OR cigarette∗ OR e-cigarette∗ OR “electronic nicotine delivery system∗ ” OR “smoking cessation” OR “smoking reduc∗ ” OR
“tobacco reduc∗ ” OR cotinine OR “carbon monoxide” OR abstinence)).
Studies were required to be available in full-text, English, and peerreviewed.
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria

2. Methods
The current review included clinical trials (randomized or not) and
observational studies (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal, and case series)
evaluating smoking cessation outcomes. Additionally, studies were required to evaluate those outcomes using machine learning. The study

We report this systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews (PRISMA; Fig. 1). The protocol for the systematic
review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022323796).

participants were individuals who smoke. We excluded studies that did
not evaluate cigarette smoking cessation, non-human studies, and all
gray literature.

studies conducted in the Netherlands (2/12), Canada (1/12), South Korea (1/12), China (1/12), and New Zealand (1/12). In the included
studies, smoking cessation was evaluated via self-report (e.g., point
prevalence abstinence, reports of relapse, and the number of cigarettes
smoked per day) and/or biochemical validation (e.g., carbon monoxide
measurements).
Demographic characteristics reported by each study can be found
in Supplementary Table 2. Most studies involved non-speciﬁc samples,
while a few studies examined more speciﬁc groups of individuals who
smoke, such as socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals [12] and
pregnant women [11]. Half of the studies (6/12) reported the baseline
number of cigarettes participants smoked, ranging from at least 100 in
their lifetime [13] to an average of 21 per day [14].

2.3. Outcome measures
Our primary measures of interest were: a) machine learning metaclasses and techniques that were used to identify b) predictors of smoking cessation outcomes.
2.4. Data collection and processing
Search results were collected and uploaded into Covidence by
L.N.A and R.F.L for subsequent processing. Two reviewers (C.L.D. and
W.H.C.) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts. A third reviewer (D.C.T.) resolved conﬂicts. Two reviewers independently conducted full-text screening (M.M. and Y.-H.Y.). A third reviewer (D.C.T)
resolved discrepancies in the full-text review. Reasons for exclusion of
full texts were recorded and documented (Fig. 1). The team of investigators carried out the extraction of data and quality assessment for
included studies (D.C.T., L.N.A., M.M., R.F.L., Y.-H.Y.). Information extracted included: study identiﬁcation, year of publication, continent,
study sample, type of study, intervention, number of participants, demographics, smoking cessation outcome measure, predictors of smoking
cessation evaluated, and machine learning method used.

3.4. Machine learning classes and techniques
All 12 included studies employed supervised machine learning techniques. Speciﬁc machine learning methods and their respective analyses
of each study are listed in Table 1. Speciﬁcally, the supervised machine
learning methods include random forest, classiﬁcation trees, regression
trees, and logistic regression. The majority of the studies (n = 7) reported the metrics of sensitivity and speciﬁcity, ﬁve studies used area
under the curve (AUC), one study included positive and negative predictive value, and three studies did not report relevant machine learning
metrics (Table 1).

2.5. Methodological quality assessment
The quality of included studies was assessed using the Mixed Method
Appraisal Tool (MMAT; [9]). The MMAT appraises the quality of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies and contains 19 methodological quality criteria to assess the quality of these studies. All 19 quality criteria domains are scored on a nominal scale (Yes/No/Can’t Tell)
to obtain an overall quality score for each included study.

3.5. Smoking cessation outcomes
Studies evaluated smoking cessation outcomes by biochemical validation, self-report, or both. Biochemical validation outcomes included
carbon monoxide assessed via expired air [expired air; 18] and cotinine assessed via saliva [27]. Self-report outcomes included point prevalence abstinence [21,22,25], the number of cigarettes smoked[expired
air; 18], Timeline Followback for use of patches and lozenges [24], relapse/lapse [16,20], abstinence [17,23], whether they were a current or
former smoker [19], and reaching their daily substance use goal for the
last seven days before discontinuing the intervention [26]. Of note, only
one study utilized both self-reported (i.e., cigarettes smoked) and biochemical validation (i.e., expired carbon monoxide) [expired air; 18].

3. Results
3.1. Search results
The initial database search yielded 4,306 citations. Two additional
studies were identiﬁed through citation searching and added. After excluding duplicates (2,025), 2,283 titles and/or abstracts were screened.
A total of 161 studies were sought for retrieval, and 136 full-text studies
were reviewed (Fig. 1), including the additional two studies that were
identiﬁed through reference list searches. We excluded 124 studies due
to: study design (n=61), outcomes (n=35), patient population (n=3),
and other (n=25; e.g., text mining of tweets and review of electronic
medical records). Overall, 12 studies were included in the review.

3.6. Predictors of smoking cessation evaluated
The 12 included studies utilized an array of smoking cessation predictors across seven categories: biomarkers; economic, environmental,
and sociodemographic; engagement; neurocognitive; physical healthrelated; psychological; and smoking severity and history (Table 2).
Biomarkers (n = 2 studies; [10,15]), included exhaled carbon monoxide or neuroimaging (i.e., anatomical and functional) as the predictors.
Economic, environmental, and sociodemographic (n = 9 studies; [11–19]),
included variables such as gender, race, household income, number of
individuals that smoke in the household, and cigarette availability. Engagement (n = 3 studies; [11,16,20]) included user response rate and
attendance predictors. Neurocognitive (n = 1 study; [21]), included measures such as executive functioning (e.g., delay discounting), memory,
and attention as predictors. Physical health-related (n = 7 studies; [12–
18]) included predictors such as body mass index, alcohol consumption, sleep quality, and hypertension. Psychological (n = 9 studies; [11–
15,17–19,21]) included predictors such as motivation, self-eﬃcacy, affect, and perceived stress. Finally, Smoking severity and history (n = 8
studies; [11,13,15–19,21]) included indicators of nicotine dependence
(e.g., the Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence; formerly known as
Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence; [22]), age of smoking initiation, and quantity of consumption.

3.2. Study characteristics and quality assessment
The overall quality of the included studies is reported in Table 1.
Additionally, the scoring of the individual MMAT items can be found
in Supplementary Table 2. One study received a MMAT score of 0% (0
quality criteria met), one study received 20% (1 quality criteria met),
four studies received 40% (2 quality criteria met), four studies received
60% (3 quality criteria met), one study received 80% (4 quality criteria
met), and the ﬁnal study received 100% (5 quality criteria met).
3.3. Demographics
The included studies’ characteristics can be found in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. The total number of participants across the studies was 40,208, with studies ranging from 39 [10] to 14,443 [11]. The
included studies were published between 2006 and 2022. Most of the
included studies were conducted in the United States (6/12), with other

3.7. Machine learning identiﬁed predictors

tematic reviews and meta-analyses that examined predictors of smoking cessation have delineated economic, environmental, and sociodemographic predictors (e.g., age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, environmental cigarette exposure) [24,25]; physical health (e.g., chronic conditions, alcohol consumption) [24,26,27]; and smoking severity and history related predictors (e.g., dependence measures, duration of smoking,
age of smoking initiation) [24,28,29]. While predictors related to economic, environmental, and sociodemographic factors, physical-healthrelated factors, and smoking severity and history can help identify who
may beneﬁt from additional interventions, without understanding underlying mechanisms of behavior change, they are less informative on
how to improve clinical interventions.
While several studies identiﬁed in this review examine the predictive
power of underlying psychological and neurocognitive mechanisms of
behavior change, neurocognitive [30] and psychological predictors of
smoking cessation outcomes [24,26,29] have similarly been established
in extant literature. For example, the cognitive-behavioral model of relapse prevention has long posited the role of aﬀective states and cognitive processes such as self-eﬃcacy and motivation as determinants of
substance use disorder relapse [31–34]. Additionally, delay discounting
is robustly related to smoking outcomes, distinguishing individuals who
smoke from controls [35–40], predicting the severity of use [36,41–43],
and treatment outcomes [44,45]. While some biomarkers for smoking
cessation have been identiﬁed (e.g., cotinine, carbon monoxide) [22] via
non-machine learning methods, machine learning has contributed to the
identiﬁcation of a novel biomarker in resting-state activity using fMRI
[10].
Two additional studies merit discussion that were systematically reviewed, but ultimately excluded. Sadasivam et al., (2016) examined a
“hybrid machine learning recommender system that selects and sends
motivational messages using algorithms that learn from message ratings”, ﬁnding that compared to standard computer-tailored health communication (CTHC), the recommender system outperformed CTHC on
measures related to self-perceived inﬂuence to quit, yet did not result
in improved smoking cessation rates [46]. Similarly, Chen et al. (2021)
analyzed smoking cessation using a recommender-based motivational
messaging intervention and found high user engagement predicted 6month smoking cessation [47]. However, these studies were excluded
from the present review for their study design because they did not utilize machine learning to evaluate smoking cessation outcomes, rather
the intervention utilized machine learning.
Four studies were found via a reference list search of a recent scoping
review by Fu et al. [48] of machine learning in tobacco research that
did not meet our inclusion criteria but merit discussion. Speciﬁcally,
Dumortier et al. used the classiﬁcation tree method to predict smoking
urges amongst individuals who initiated a quit attempt. These ﬁndings
could be translated into improved clinical interventions for smoking cessation as predictors [49]. Huda et al. used a cluster-based rule discovery
model to predict intention to quit among individuals who smoke, ﬁnding
that the decision forest is more accurate in predicting smokers’ intention
to quit than single decision trees [50]. Singh & Katyan utilized decision
trees to predict nicotine dependence amongst 9,190 individuals who
smoke and 13,357 individuals who use smokeless tobacco, ﬁnding that
duration of use most accurately predicted nicotine dependence [51]. Finally, one study was excluded because the machine learning techniques
served as the study intervention rather than the methods utilized to predict smoking cessation outcomes. Speciﬁcally, Alsharif & Philip examined multilayer perceptron, logistic regression, Bayes network, Naïve
Bayes, random subspace, and J48 to predict self-reported smoking cessation at 3-months following a smartphone intervention, ﬁnding that the
Naïve Bayes algorithm correctly classiﬁed 84.7% of individuals [52].
While these studies utilized machine learning in cessation related areas,
they did not directly address smoking cessation and were not included
here.

The factors with the highest predictive utility identiﬁed for each
included study are listed in Table 2. Overall, the predictors with the
highest predictive utility identiﬁed in the 12 studies (presented alphabetically by lead author’s last name) were delay discounting, the reduction in reward value as a function of delay to receipt [21], having
individuals who smoke daily at home [16], attendance in smoking cessation education [16], more positive experiences (measured by the Vaping Experiences Score) [17], higher perceived odds of smoking today
[14], increased conﬁdence to avoid smoking [14], the belief that medication is dangerous [18], scores on the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives [WISDM; 23] (i.e., cognitive enhancement, primary dependence, and taste/sensory properties) [18], parent ethnicity
[11], smoking intervals [11], boredom [11], male sex[11], consumption
during intervention commencement [20], engagement [20], irritability [12], cigarette availability [12], exposure to individuals who smoke
[12], smoking restrictions [12], recent alcohol consumption [12], resting state brain networks [10], and motivation [19] and education level
[19]. Together, these predictors identiﬁed by this review comprised all
seven categories mentioned above. Included studies evaluated which
predictors to include in several ways: a priori determinations, model reduction, and variable selection (Supplementary Table 1). The included
studies estimated the predictive ability of these measures in a number
of ways, including measures of importance, odds ratios (odds of observing an outcome given an exposure compared to its absence [24]), Univariate cox proportional hazards regression models (probability that an
individual experiences a given event centered around a deﬁned point
in time [25]), and Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) importance
plots (quantify the prediction of an instance through the contribution
of each feature to the prediction [26]). We recognize some of the utilized strategies have more straightforward interpretations in the feature
space, while others have a more “black box” approach, and identifying feature importance is not trivial. For a review of these methods, see
[27].
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review to evaluate the
use of machine learning methods to predict smoking cessation outcomes.
We surveyed the types and classes of machine learning methods used
to predict smoking cessation. Subsequently, we reported the currently
utilized predictors of smoking cessation encompassing seven categories
and highlighted those with the most robust predictive utility. Lastly, we
summarized the outcome measures of smoking cessation.
Machine learning approaches provide powerful tools that can answer
questions through a diﬀerent paradigm. Many view machine learning
as an enigma that is successful for prediction but challenging for interpretation. This perspective may be true for some approaches, like
Support Vector Machines and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. However, a
subset of machine learning approaches are tree-based (e.g., classiﬁcation and regression trees, decision trees), and provide a highly interpretable model. Medina et al. [11] identiﬁed several psychological factors (i.e., mood and self-eﬃcacy) as strong predictors of cessation. Additionally, Couglin et al. [21] used classiﬁcation and regression trees to
examine various psychological and neurocognitive measures as predictors of smoking cessation in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment. Delay discounting, the reduction in reward value as a function
of delay to receipt, emerged as the strongest predictor, correctly identifying the smoking status of 80% of participants post-treatment. These
results demonstrate the utility of tree-based machine learning to inform
clinical interventions for smoking cessation.
Many of the strongest predictors identiﬁed by machine learning
methods are consistent with those previously established by nonmachine learning methods in the extant literature. For example, sys-

4.1. Limitations and potential future directions

Declaration of Competing Interests

A major limitation of this area of research is the paucity of inclusion of the neurobehavioral mechanisms underpinning smokingrelated decision-making. The competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS) theory postulates addiction in part arises from an imbalance in the executive and impulsive decision-making systems [53,54].
Delay discounting has been identiﬁed as an index of CNDS balance
where individuals with higher delay discounting rates display hyperactivation in impulsive neural systems (e.g., limbic system regions) and
hypoactivation of executive regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) [55]. Therefore, the inclusion of delay discounting and, perhaps, other neurocognitive decision-making constructs within machine learning and smoking cessation is a future direction that could identify novel therapeutic
targets (c.f.,[30]). Research shows that eﬀective smoking intervention
treatment, which did not target delay discounting directly, changed delay discounting via rate-dependent eﬀects; that is, individuals with the
highest delay discounting rates at baseline saw the greatest changes in
discounting post-treatment [56]. Interventions that reduce discounting
also produce concomitant reductions in cigarette demand [57,58]. Thus,
the inclusion of delay discounting within machine learning models has
the potential utility for a more personalized treatment approach.
Other limitations in this ﬁeld are an apparent (1) reliance on selfreported measures, both as explanatory (e.g., FTND) and smoking cessation outcomes (e.g., cigarettes per day); the robustness of utilizing machine learning would improve by including clinical diagnoses and biochemical veriﬁcation of smoking cessation (e.g., CO levels). (2) Applying machine learning approaches to smaller and homogenous data sets
may result in overﬁtting. This limitation can potentially be overcome by
utilizing large data sets (as done in [13]) and evaluating models on an
independent data set (as done in Coughlin et al., 2020 [21]). (3) All of
the studies reported herein implemented supervised machine learning.
Alternative options, such as unsupervised and reinforcement learning,
could yield additional knowledge about predicting smoking cessation.
(4) Two studies did not report the strongest predictor of smoking cessation and, therefore, cannot be used to inform clinical interventions. This
limitation can be mitigated by fully reporting predictors used and their
respective predictive abilities.
In addition to the ﬁeld-wide limitations described above, we acknowledge several potential limitations in this review’s methodology.
While we relied on MeSH subheaders to identify search terms for smoking cessation and machine learning; we recognize the MeSH subheaders for machine learning may not be comprehensive. For example, not
all authors view logistic regression as a machine-learning approach. In
this review, we operationalized machine learning as a paper annotated
with the corresponding MeSh subheader. Thus, our search was potentially limited in that only studies identiﬁed with these search terms were
included (see Section 2.1 for search terms), and others using similar
methodologies were excluded. Similar limitations arise from using the
MeSh subheaders for tobacco use. Second, while a review of related
works did identify two references included in this review, a formal snowball search procedure was not utilized.

5. Conclusions
In sum, machine learning approaches have yet to improve the smoking cessation paradigm notably and are limited in their ability to improve clinical outcomes. However, the ﬁeld is still relatively nascent,
with a critical gap in understanding neural bases underlying mechanisms of decision-making and behavior change. Utilizing decisiontree-based machine learning methods when investigating neural-based
decision-making processes may provide the most informative and interpretable models to improve clinical outcomes.

The behaviour change wheel: A new method for
characterising and designing behaviour change
interventions
Susan Michie1*, Maartje M van Stralen2 and Robert West3

Abstract
Background: Improving the design and implementation of evidence-based practice depends on successful
behaviour change interventions. This requires an appropriate method for characterising interventions and linking
them to an analysis of the targeted behaviour. There exists a plethora of frameworks of behaviour change
interventions, but it is not clear how well they serve this purpose. This paper evaluates these frameworks, and
develops and evaluates a new framework aimed at overcoming their limitations.
Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases and consultation with behaviour change experts were used
to identify frameworks of behaviour change interventions. These were evaluated according to three criteria:
comprehensiveness, coherence, and a clear link to an overarching model of behaviour. A new framework was
developed to meet these criteria. The reliability with which it could be applied was examined in two domains of
behaviour change: tobacco control and obesity.
Results: Nineteen frameworks were identified covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories
that could enable those interventions. None of the frameworks reviewed covered the full range of intervention
functions or policies, and only a minority met the criteria of coherence or linkage to a model of behaviour. At the
centre of a proposed new framework is a ‘behaviour system’ involving three essential conditions: capability,
opportunity, and motivation (what we term the ‘COM-B system’). This forms the hub of a ‘behaviour change wheel’
(BCW) around which are positioned the nine intervention functions aimed at addressing deficits in one or more of
these conditions; around this are placed seven categories of policy that could enable those interventions to occur.
The BCW was used reliably to characterise interventions within the English Department of Health’s 2010 tobacco
control strategy and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence’s guidance on reducing obesity.
Conclusions: Interventions and policies to change behaviour can be usefully characterised by means of a BCW
comprising: a ‘behaviour system’ at the hub, encircled by intervention functions and then by policy categories.
Research is needed to establish how far the BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.

Background
Improving the implementation of evidence-based practice and public health depends on behaviour change.
Thus, behaviour change interventions are fundamental
to the effective practice of clinical medicine and public
health, as indeed they are to many pressing issues facing
society. ‘Behaviour change interventions’ can be defined
as coordinated sets of activities designed to change

specified behaviour patterns. In general, these behaviour
patterns are measured in terms of the prevalence or
incidence of particular behaviours in specified populations (e.g., delivery of smoking cessation advice by general practitioners). Interventions are used to promote
uptake and optimal use of effective clinical services, and
to promote healthy lifestyles. Evidence of intervention
effectiveness serves to guide health providers to implement what is considered to be best practice (for example, Cochrane reviews, NICE guidance). While there are
many examples of successful interventions, there are
also countless examples of ones that it was hoped would

be effective but were not [[1], e.g. [2,3]]. To improve this
situation, and to improve the translation of research into
practice, we need to develop the science and technology
of behaviour change and make this useful to those
designing interventions and planning policy.
The process of designing behaviour change interventions usually involves first of all determining the broad
approach that will be adopted and then working on the
specifics of the intervention design. For example, when
attempting to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing
one may decide that an educational intervention is the
appropriate approach. Alternatively, one may seek to
incentivise appropriate prescribing or in some way penalise inappropriate prescribing. Once one has done this,
one would decide on the specific intervention components. This paper examines this first part of this process.
We and others are also working on how one identifies
specific component ‘behaviour change techniques’ [4,5].
In order to identify the type or types of intervention
that are likely to be effective, it is important to canvass
the full range of options available and use a rational system for selecting from among them. This requires a system for characterising interventions that covers all
possible intervention types together with a system for
matching these features to the behavioural target, the target population, and the context in which the intervention
will be delivered. This should be underpinned by a model
of behaviour and the factors that influence it.
Interventions are commonly designed without evidence
of having gone through this kind of process, with no formal analysis of either the target behaviour or the theoretically predicted mechanisms of action. They are based
on implicit commonsense models of behaviour [6]. Even
when one or more models or theories are chosen to
guide the intervention, they do not cover the full range of
possible influences so exclude potentially important variables. For example, the often used Theory of Planned
Behaviour and Health Belief Model do not address the
important roles of impulsivity, habit, self-control, associative learning, and emotional processing [7].
In addition, often no analysis is undertaken to guide
the choice of theories [8]. Useful guidance from the UK
Medical Research Council for developing and evaluating
complex interventions advocates drawing on theory in
intervention design but does not specify how to select
and apply theory [9]. It should also be noted that even
when interventions are said to be guided by theory, in
practice they are often not or are only minimally [10].
Thus, in order to improve intervention design, we
need a systematic method that incorporates an understanding of the nature of the behaviour to be changed,
and an appropriate system for characterising interventions and their components that can make use of this
understanding. These constitute a starting point for

Page 2 of 11

assessing in what circumstances different types of intervention are likely to be effective which can then form
the basis for intervention design.
There exists a plethora of frameworks for classifying
behaviour change interventions but an informal analysis
suggests that none are comprehensive and conceptually
coherent. For example, ‘MINDSPACE’ an influential
report from the UK’s Institute of Government, is
intended as a checklist for policymakers of the most
important influences on behaviour [11]. These influences provide initial letters for the acronym MINDSPACE: messenger, incentives, norms, defaults, salience,
priming, affect, commitment, and ego. The framework
does not appear to encompass all the important intervention types. Moreover, the list is a mixture of modes
of delivery (e.g., messenger), stimulus attributes (e.g., salience), characteristics of the recipient (e.g., ego), policy
strategies (e.g., defaults), mechanisms of action (e.g.,
priming), and related psychological constructs (e.g.,
affect). In that sense it lacks coherence. The report
recognises two systems by which human behaviour can
be influenced – the reflective and the automatic – but it
focuses on the latter and does not attempt to link influences on behaviour with these two systems.
A second example comes from the Cochrane Effective
Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group
(EPOC)’s 2010 taxonomy [12]. This categorises interventions to change health professional behaviour into professional, financial, organisational, or regulatory,
covering many of the key intervention types. However,
the categories are very broad and within each is a mixture of different types of interventions at different conceptual levels. For example, ‘professional’ includes
individual behaviour (distributing educational materials)
and organisational interventions (local consensus processes); ‘financial’ includes individual and organisational
incentives and environmental restructuring (changing
the available products); ‘organisational’ includes input
(changing skill mix), processes (communication) and
effects (satisfaction of providers); and ‘regulatory’
includes legal (changes in patient liability) and social
influence (peer review). Professional, financial, and organisational interventions are found across all categories.
Aside from specific frameworks, there are some broad
distinctions that have been widely adopted. One such
distinction is between population-level and individuallevel interventions [13]. While superficially appealing,
there are many interventions that this distinction cannot
readily classify and it has not been possible to arrive at
a satisfactory definition of the distinction that does not
contain inconsistencies. For example, if wide reach is a
feature of population level interventions, routine general
practitioner (GP) smoking assessment and advice (given
to all patients) should fall into that category; yet it is

Michie et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:42
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/42

delivered specifically to individuals and can be tailored
to those individuals. Indeed, the NHS Stop Smoking
Services might be considered a typical case of individual-level interventions, but they reach more than
600,000 smokers each year [14]. We do not consider
these broad distinctions further in this paper.
It appears that most intervention designers do not use
existing frameworks as a basis for developing new interventions or for analysing why some interventions have
failed while others have succeeded. One reason for this
may be that these frameworks do not meet their needs.
In order to choose the interventions likely to be most
effective, it makes sense to start with a model of behaviour. This model should capture the range of mechanisms that may be involved in change, including those
that are internal (psychological and physical) and those
that involve changes to the external environment. In
general, insufficient attention appears to be given to
analysing the nature of behaviour as the starting point
of behaviour change interventions [15], a notable exception being intervention mapping [16]. ‘Nature of the
behaviour’ was identified as one of 12 theoretical
domains of influence on implementation-relevant behaviours [9]. Whilst this framework of 12 theoretical
domains has proved useful in assessing and intervening
with implementation problems [9], the domain of behaviour has remained under-theorised and therefore
underused in its application.
There are a number of possible objections to attempting to construct the kind of behavioural model
described and link this to intervention types. The most
obvious criticism is that the area is too complex and
that the constructs too ill-defined to be able to establish
a useful, scientifically-based framework. Another is that
no framework can address the level of detail required to
determine what will or will not be an effective intervention. The response to this is twofold: these are empirical
questions and there is already evidence that characterising interventions by behaviour change techniques
(BCTs) can be helpful in understanding which interventions are more or less effective [6,17]; and not to
embark on this enterprise is to give up on achieving a
science of behaviour change before the first hurdle and
condemn this field to opinion and fashion.
To achieve its goal, a framework for characterising
interventions should be comprehensive: it should apply
to every intervention that has been or could be developed. Failure to do this limits the scope of the system to
offer options for intervention designers that may be
effective.
Second, the framework needs to be coherent in that
its categories are all exemplars of the same type of entity
and have a broadly similar level of specificity. Thus,
categories should be from a super-ordinate entity (e.g.,

Page 3 of 11

function of the intervention), and the framework should
not include some categories that are very broad and
others very specific. A beautiful example of an incoherent classification system is the Ancient Chinese Classification of Animals: ‘those that belong to the Emperor,
embalmed ones, those that are trained, suckling pigs,
mermaids, fabulous ones, stray dogs, those that are
included in this classification, those that tremble as if
they were mad, innumerable ones, those drawn with a
very fine camel’s hair brush, others, those that have just
broken a flower vase, and those that resemble flies from
a distance’ (Luis Borges ‘Other Inquisitions: 1937-1952’).
In addition, the categories should be able to be linked
to specific behaviour change mechanisms that in turn
can be linked to the model of behaviour. These requirements constitute three criteria of usefulness that can be
used to evaluate the framework: comprehensiveness,
coherence, and links to an overarching model of behaviour. We limited the criteria to those we considered to
form a basis for judging adequacy. There are others, e.g.,
parsimony, that are desirable features but do not lend
themselves to thresholds. Other criteria can be used to
evaluate its applicability, e.g., reliability, ease of use, ease
of communication, ability to explain outcomes, usefulness for generating new interventions, and ability to predict effectiveness of interventions
In light of the above, this paper aims to:
1. Review existing frameworks of behavioural interventions to establish how far each meets the criteria of usefulness, and to identify a comprehensive list of
intervention descriptors at a level of generality that is
usable by intervention designers and policy makers.
2. Use this list to construct a framework of behaviour
change interventions that meets the usefulness criteria
listed above.
3. Establish the reliability with which the new framework can be used to characterise interventions in two
public health domains.

Methods
Prior to reviewing the literature on intervention frameworks, we needed to establish a set of criteria for evaluating their usefulness. Following this, our method
involved three steps: a systematic literature review and
evaluation of existing behaviour change intervention frameworks, development of a new framework, and a test
of the reliability of the new framework.
Establishing criteria of usefulness

From the analysis set out in the Introduction, we established three criteria of usefulness:
1. Comprehensive coverage – the framework should
apply to every intervention that has been or could be
developed: failure to do this limits the scope of the

Michie et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:42
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/42

system to offer options for intervention designers that
may be effective.
2. Coherence, i.e., categories are all exemplars of the
same type and specificity of entity.
3. Links to an overarching model of behaviour.
We use the term ‘model’ here in the sense defined in the
Oxford English Dictionary: ‘a hypothetical description of a
complex entity or process.’ For the overarching model of
behaviour, we started with motivation, defined as: brain
processes that energize and direct behaviour) [18]. This is
a much broader conceptualisation than appears in many
discourses, covering as it does basic drives and ‘automatic’
processes as well as choice and intention.
Our next step was to consider the minimum number
of additional factors needed to account for whether
change in the behavioural target would occur, given sufficient motivation. We drew on two sources representing very different traditions: a US consensus meeting of
behavioural theorists in 1991 [19], and a principle of US
criminal law dating back many centuries. The former
identified three factors that were necessary and sufficient prerequisites for the performance of a specified
volitional behaviour: the skills necessary to perform the
behaviour, a strong intention to perform the behaviour,
and no environmental constraints that make it impossible to perform the behaviour. Under US criminal law, in
order to prove that someone is guilty of a crime one has
to show three things: means or capability, opportunity,
and motive. This suggested a potentially elegant way of
representing the necessary conditions for a volitional
behaviour to occur. The common conclusion from these
two separate strands of thought lends confidence to this
model of behaviour. We have built on this to add nonvolitional mechanisms involved in motivation (e.g.,
habits) and to conceptualise causal associations between
the components in an interacting system.
In this ‘behaviour system,’ capability, opportunity, and
motivation interact to generate behaviour that in turn
influences these components as shown in Figure 1 (the
‘COM-B’ system). Capability is defined as the individual’s psychological and physical capacity to engage in
the activity concerned. It includes having the necessary
knowledge and skills. Motivation is defined as all those
brain processes that energize and direct behaviour, not
just goals and conscious decision-making. It includes
habitual processes, emotional responding, as well as analytical decision-making. Opportunity is defined as all the
factors that lie outside the individual that make the
behaviour possible or prompt it. The single-headed and
double-headed arrows in Figure 1 represent potential
influence between components in the system. For example, opportunity can influence motivation as can capability; enacting a behaviour can alter capability,
motivation, and opportunity.

Figure 1 The COM-B system - a framework for understanding
behaviour.

A given intervention might change one or more components in the behaviour system. The causal links
within the system can work to reduce or amplify the
effect of particular interventions by leading to changes
elsewhere. While this is a model of behaviour, it also
provides a basis for designing interventions aimed at
behaviour change. Applying this to intervention design,
the task would be to consider what the behavioural target would be, and what components of the behaviour
system would need to be changed to achieve that.
This system places no priority on an individual, group,
or environmental perspective – intra-psychic and external factors all have equal status in controlling behaviour.
However, for a given behaviour in a given context it
provides a way of identifying how far changing particular components or combinations of components could
effect the required transformation. For example, with
one behavioural target the only barrier might be capability, while for another it may be enough to provide or
restrict opportunities, while for yet another changes to
capability, motivation, and opportunity may be required.
Within the three components that generate behaviour,
it is possible to develop further subdivisions that capture
important distinctions noted in the research literature.
Thus, with regard to capability, we distinguished
between physical and psychological capability (psychological capability being the capacity to engage in the
necessary thought processes - comprehension, reasoning
et al.). With opportunity, we distinguished between physical opportunity afforded by the environment and social
opportunity afforded by the cultural milieu that dictates
the way that we think about things (e.g., the words and
concepts that make up our language). With regard to
motivation, we distinguished between reflective processes (involving evaluations and plans) and automatic
processes (involving emotions and impulses that arise
from associative learning and/or innate dispositions)
[7,18,20]. Thus, we identified six components within the
behavioural system (Figure 1). All, apart from reflective

Michie et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:42
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/42

motivation, are necessary for a given behaviour but it is
possible to generate a profile of which should be targeted to achieve the behavioural target.
Systematic literature review of current frameworks

We used the following search terms to identify scholarly
articles containing frameworks of behaviour change
interventions: Topic = (taxonomy or framework or classification) AND Topic = (’behaviour change’ or ‘behavior change’) AND Topic = (prevention OR intervention
OR promotion OR treatment OR program OR programme OR policy OR law OR politics OR regulation
OR government OR institute OR legislation).
Searches of Web of Science (Science and Social Science
databases), Pubmed. and PsycInfo were supplemented by
consulting with eight international experts in behaviour
change, drawn from the disciplines of psychology, health
promotion, epidemiology, public health, and anthropology. Given that there may be frameworks described in
books and non peer-reviewed articles, we acknowledged
that it was unlikely that we would arrive at a complete
set, but we sought to canvass enough to be able to undertake an analysis of how well as a whole they matched the
criteria described earlier and to achieve sufficient coverage of the key concepts and labels.
Documents were included if: they described a framework of behaviour change interventions (not specific
behaviour change techniques); the framework was specified in enough detail to allow their key features to be
discerned; and they were written in English. They were
originally selected on the basis of titles and abstracts. A
subset was then selected using the inclusion criteria for
full review. The nature of the topic meant that this
review could not be undertaken using the PRISMA
guidelines [21].
Once the frameworks were identified, their categories
and category definitions were extracted and tabulated.
This was done independently by MS and a researcher
who was not part of the study team or familiar with this
work. The frameworks were coded according to the criteria for usefulness by RW and SM.
Develop a new framework

The new framework was developed by tabulating the full
set of intervention categories that had been identified
and establishing links between intervention characteristics and components of the COM-B system that may
need to be changed. The definitions and conceptualisation of the intervention categories were refined through
discussion and by consulting the American Psychological Association’s Dictionary of Psychology and the
Oxford English Dictionary. The resulting framework was
then compared with the existing ones in terms of the
criteria of usefulness (i.e., met or not met).

Page 5 of 11

Finally, a structure for the framework, in terms of
organisation of components and links between them
was arrived at through an iterative process of discussion
and testing against specific examples and counter-examples. Linking interventions to components of the behaviour system was achieved with the help of a broad
theory of motivation that encapsulated both reflective
and automatic aspects, and focused on the moment to
moment control of behaviour by the internal and external environment which in turn is influenced by that
behaviour and the processes leading up to it [7]. Thus,
for example, interventions that involved coercion could
influence reflective motivation by changing conscious
evaluations of the options or by establishing automatic
associations between anticipation of the behaviour and
negative feelings in the presence of particular cues.
There is not the space to go into details of this analysis
here. These can be found in [7].
Test the reliability of the framework

The framework was used independently by RW and SM
to classify the 24 components of the 2010 English government tobacco control strategy [22] and the 21 components of the 2006 NICE obesity guidance [23]. The
level of inter-rater agreement was computed and any
differences resolved through discussion. The areas of
tobacco control and obesity reduction were chosen
because these are among the most important in public
health and ones where health professional behaviour has
consistently been found to fall short of that recommended by evidence-based guidelines [24-26]. In addition, these documents cover a wide spectrum of
behaviour change approaches. Following reliability testing and discussion of any disagreements, a ‘gold standard’ was established.
Next, reliability of use by practitioners was assessed by
asking two policy experts (the Department of Health
Policy Lead for implementation of the 2010 English government tobacco control strategy and a tobacco
researcher) to independently classify the 24 components
of the strategy (see Additional file 1 for coding materials). Their coding data were compared with the ‘gold
standard.’

Results
Systematic literature review of existing frameworks

From the systematic literature search, 1,267 articles were
identified from the electronic databases, eight of which
met our inclusion criteria. The expert consultations produced a further 17 articles, 11 of which met the inclusion criteria resulting in a total of 19 articles describing
19 frameworks. (See Additional file 2 for more detail of
flow of studies through the review process, and
Additional file 3 for reasons for exclusion). Additional

file 4 shows the frameworks and gives a brief description
of each [11,12,16,27-42].
Several things became apparent when reviewing the
frameworks. First of all, it was clear it would be necessary to define terms describing categories of intervention
more precisely than is done in everyday language in
order to achieve coherence. For example, in everyday
language ‘education’ can include ‘training,’ but for our
purposes it was necessary to distinguish between ‘education’ and ‘training’ with the former focusing on imparting knowledge and developing understanding and the
latter focusing on development of skills. Similarly we
had to differentiate ‘training’ from ‘modelling.’ In common parlance, modelling could be a method used in
training, but we use the term more specifically to refer
to using our propensity to imitate as a motivational
device. A third example is the use of the term ‘enablement.’ In everyday use, this could include most of the
other intervention categories, but here refers to forms of
enablement that are either more encompassing (as in,
for example, ‘behavioural support’ for smoking cessation) or work through other mechanisms (as in, for
example, pharmacological interventions to aid smoking
cessation or surgery to enable control of calorie intake).
There is not a term in the English language to describe
that we intend, so rather than invent a new term we
have stayed with ‘enablement.’
Second, it became apparent that a distinction needed
to be made between interventions (activities aimed at
changing behaviour) and policies (actions on the part of
responsible authorities that enable or support interventions). For example, an intervention that involved incentivising primary care organisations to prioritise public
health interventions could be implemented through different policies such as producing guidelines and/or legislation. A second example is that raising the financial
cost of a behaviour whose incidence one wishes to
reduce (an example of coercion) could be enabled and
supported by different policies, from fiscal measures
(taxation) to legislation (fines). We therefore had to
divide the categories that emerged into ‘interventions’
and ‘policies.’
Third, any given intervention could in principle perform more than one behaviour change function. Thus
the intervention categories identified from the 19 existing frameworks were better conceived of as non-overlapping functions: a given intervention may involve
more than one of these. For example, a specific instance
of brief physician advice to reduce alcohol consumption
may involve the three different functions of education,
persuasion, and enablement, whereas another may
involve only one or two of these. With regard to the
policies, it was possible to treat them as non-overlapping
categories.

Page 6 of 11

With this in mind, scrutiny of the frameworks yielded
a set of nine intervention functions and seven policy
categories that were included in at least one framework.
Table 1 lists these and their definitions (their sources
are detailed in Additional file 5). Additional file 6 shows
whether or not the intervention functions and policy
categories were covered by each of the reviewed frameworks. The inter-rater reliability for coding the frameworks by intervention functions and policy categories
was 88%.
Additional file 7 shows how existing frameworks met
the criteria of usefulness. It is apparent that no framework covered all the functions and categories and thus
did not meet the criterion of comprehensiveness. Only
three frameworks met the criterion of coherence. Seven
were explicitly linked to an overarching model of
behaviour.
Development of a new framework

Given that policies can only influence behaviour through
the interventions that they enable or support, it seemed
appropriate to place interventions between these and
behaviour. The most parsimonious way of doing this
seemed to be to represent the whole classification system in terms of a ‘behaviour change wheel’ (BCW) with
three layers as shown in Figure 2. This is not a linear
model in that components within the behaviour system
interact with each other as do the functions within the
intervention layer and the categories within the policy
layer.
Having established the structure of the new framework,
the next step was to link the components of the behaviour system to the intervention functions and to link
these to policy categories using the approach described
in the Methods section. This led to a framework that met
the third criterion of linkage with an overarching model
of behaviour change (Tables 2 and 3).
Testing the reliability of the new framework

The initial coding of the intervention functions and policy categories of the 2010 English Tobacco Control
Strategy was achieved with an inter-rater agreement of
88%. The inter-rater agreement for the NICE Obesity
Guidance was 79%. Differences were readily resolved
through discussion (see Additional file 8 for details of
the analysis). The percentage agreement between the
identified components and the ‘gold standard’ was 85%
for the implementation lead for the 2010 English government tobacco control strategy in the Department of
Health and 75% for the tobacco researcher.

policy categories could be discerned. None of the frameworks covered all of these. Only a minority of the frameworks could be regarded as coherent or linked to an
overarching model of behaviour. However, it was possible to construct a new BCW framework that did meet

these criteria from the existing ones. This framework
could be reliably applied to classify interventions within
two important areas of public health.
We believe that this is the first attempt to undertake a
systematic analysis of behaviour intervention frameworks and apply usefulness criteria to them. This is also
the first time that a new framework has been constructed from existing frameworks explicitly to overcome their limitations. Moreover, we are not aware of
other attempts to assess the reliability with which a framework can be applied in practice.
It must be recognised that there are a near infinite
number of ways of classifying interventions and intervention functions. The one arrived at here will no doubt
be superseded. But for the present, it has the benefits of
having been derived from classifications already available
and therefore covering concepts that have previously
been considered to be important, and using an overarching model of behaviour to link interventions to
potential behavioural targets. The most important test
of this framework will be whether it provides a more

1. Physical capability can be achieved through physical skill development which is the focus of training or potentially through enabling interventions such as
medication, surgery or prostheses.
2. Psychological capability can be achieved through imparting knowledge or understanding, training emotional, cognitive and/or behavioural skills or through
enabling interventions such as medication.
3. Reflective motivation can be achieved through increasing knowledge and understanding, eliciting positive (or negative) feelings about behavioural target.
4. Automatic motivation can be achieved through associative learning that elicit positive (or negative) feelings and impulses and counter-impulses relating to the
behavioural target, imitative learning, habit formation or direct influences on automatic motivational processes (e.g., via medication).

efficient method of choosing the kinds of intervention
that are likely to be appropriate for a given behavioural
target in a given context and a given population.
Just by identifying all the potential intervention functions and policy categories this framework could prevent
policy makers and intervention designers from neglecting important options. For example, it has been used in
UK parliamentary circles to demonstrate to Members of
Parliament that the current UK Government is ignoring
important evidence-based interventions to change behaviour in relation to public health [43,44]. By focusing on
environmental restructuring, some incentivisation and
forms of subtle persuasion to influence behaviour, as
advocated by the popular book ‘Nudge’ [45], the UK
Government eschews the use of coercion, persuasion, or
the other BCW intervention functions that one might
use.
Although awareness of the full range of interventions
and policies is important for intervention design, the
BCW goes beyond providing this. It forms the basis for
a systematic analysis of how to make the selection of
interventions and policies (as in Tables 2 and 3). Having
selected the intervention function or functions most

likely to be effective in changing a particular target
behaviour, these can then be linked to more fine-grained
specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs). Any one
intervention function is likely to comprise many individual BCTs, and the same BCT may serve different intervention functions. An examination of BCTs used in selfmanagement approaches to increasing physical activity
and healthy eating [46], and in behavioural support for
smoking cessation [47,48], shows that these BCTs serve
five of the intervention functions: education, persuasion,
incentivisation, training, and enablement. The other four
intervention functions (coercion, restriction, environmental restructuring, and modelling) place more emphasis on external influences and less on personal agency.
Reliable taxonomies for BCTs within these intervention
functions have yet to be developed.
One of the strengths of this framework is that it
incorporates context very naturally. There is a general
recognition that context is key to the effective design
and implementation of interventions, but it remains
under-theorised and under-investigated. The ‘opportunity’ component of the behavioural model is the context,
so that behaviour can only be understood in relation to

context. Behaviour in context is thus the starting point
of intervention design. The behaviour system also has
automatic processing at its heart, broadening the understanding of behaviour beyond the more reflective, systematic cognitive processes that have been the focus of
much behavioural research in implementation science
and health psychology (for example, social cognition
models such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour).
An existing framework that has made an important
contribution to making intervention design more systematic is ‘intervention mapping’ [16]. A key difference
between this and the BCW approach is that intervention
mapping aims to map behaviour on to its ‘theoretical
determinants’ in order to identify potential levers for
change, whereas the BCW approach recognises that the
target behaviour can in principle arise from combinations of any of the components of the behaviour system.
It may appear that some components are more important than others because of a lack of variance in (including absence or universal presence of) the variables
concerned in the population under study. This can be
illustrated by a study of GP advice to smokers, which
found that a single variable – degree of concern that it
would harm the doctor-patient relationship – accounted
for significant variance in the rate of advice-giving [49].
‘Intervention mapping’ would suggest that concern be
the target for an intervention (as long as a judgement
were made that this could be modified using interventions that were realistically applicable). The BCW would
analyse the target behaviour in context and note that,
regardless of what covariation might currently exist, the
target behaviour consists of an activity in which capability is not at issue, and the reflective motivation is
broadly positive. The problem arises because automatic
motivational factors are currently working against the
behaviour (e.g., lack of emotional reward for giving
advice or punishment for not giving it and lack of cues
to action). Moreover, the physical opportunity is limited
(lack of time) and the social opportunities are also
somewhat limited. It would then consider the full range
of ways in which the frequency of advice-giving could
be increased. Because the target behaviour is part of a
‘system,’ a single intervention may have consequences
for other parts of the system - these might work against
sustainable change or in favour of it.
Thus, the BCW approach is based on a comprehensive
causal analysis of behaviour and starts with the question:
‘What conditions internal to individuals and in their
social and physical environment need to be in place for
a specified behavioural target to be achieved?’ The
‘intervention mapping’ approach is based on an epidemiological analysis of co-variation within the behavioural domain and starts with the question: ‘What
factors in the present population at the present time

Page 9 of 11

underlie variation in the behavioural parameter?’ When
it comes to theoretical underpinnings, the BCW
approach draws from a single unifying theory of motivation in context that predicts what aspects of the motivational system will need to be influenced in what ways to
achieve a behavioural target, whereas the ‘intervention
mapping’ approach draws on a range of theoretical
approaches each of which independently addresses different aspects of the behaviour in question.
The BCW is being developed into a theory- and evidence-based tool allowing a range of users to design
and select interventions and policies according to an
analysis of the nature of the behaviour, the mechanisms
that need to be changed in order to bring about behaviour change, and the interventions and policies
required to change those mechanisms. An ongoing programme of research is developing an ‘intervention
design tool’ based on the BCW. It starts with a theoretical understanding of behaviour to determine what needs
to change in order for the behavioural target to be
achieved, and what intervention functions are likely to
be effective to bring about that change. It is being field
tested by a range of staff involved in policy and intervention work applying the framework to develop prototype strategies for specific implementation targets. Data
are being collected about ease of use and the potential
of the BCW to generate new insights.
There are a number of limitations to the research
described in this paper. First, it is possible that the systematic review missed important frameworks and/or
intervention functions. Second, judgement is inevitably
involved in conceptualising intervention functions and
policy categories. There are many different ways of
doing this, and no guarantees that the one arrived at
here is optimal. Indeed, different frameworks may be
more or less useful in different circumstances. Third,
even though the proposed framework appears to be
comprehensive and can be used reliably to characterise
interventions, it is possible that it may prove difficult to
use. However, the systematic way in which development

Abstract
Aims: This study aims to compare biomarkers of potential harm between people switching from smoking combustible cigarettes (CC) completely to electronic cigarettes (EC),
continuing to smoke CC, using both EC and CC (dual users) and using neither
(abstainers), based on behaviour during EC intervention studies.
Design: Secondary analysis following systematic review, incorporating inverse variance

Participants: A total of 1299 adults smoking CC (nine studies) and provided EC.
Measurements: Measurements were conducted using carbon monoxide (CO) and 26
other biomarkers.
Findings: In pooled analyses, exhaled CO (eCO) was lower in EC versus EC + CC [mean
difference (MD) = −4.40 parts per million (p.p.m.), 95% confidence interval (CI) = −12.04
to 3.24, two studies] and CC (MD = −9.57 p.p.m., 95% CI = −17.30 to −1.83, three studies). eCO was lower in dual users versus CC only (MD = −1.91 p.p.m., 95% CI = −3.38 to

−0.45, two studies). Magnitude rather than direction of effect drove substantial statistical heterogeneity. Effect direction plots were used for other biomarkers. Comparing EC
with CC, 12 of 13 biomarkers were significantly lower in EC users, with no difference for
the 13th. Comparing EC with dual users, 12 of the 25 biomarkers were lower for EC, and
five were lower for dual use. For the remaining eight measures, single studies did not
detect statistically significant differences, or the multiple studies contributing to the outcome had inconsistent results. Only one study provided data comparing dual use with
CC; of the 13 biomarkers measured, 12 were significantly lower in the dual use group,
with no statistically significant difference detected for the 13th. Only one study provided
data on abstainers.

Cravo et al. [8] reports data on a subset of participants who were confined for the first week of the study; all complied with study protocols during this
period. Data are available in figures only; error bars do not overlap. In Gonieciwz et al. [9], all participants were given an electronic cigarette (EC) at baseline.
After 2 weeks, statistically significant declines in 12 of 17 measured biomarkers of exposure to toxicants were observed. Authors also conducted a
secondary analysis comparing changes at 2 weeks between those who switched completely to EC and those who used both EC and combustible cigarettes
(CC). They give only absolute values (in their Supporting information, Table S3). In Morris et al. [6], all participants exclusively used EC at days 1–9 and then
were randomized to three groups from days 10 to 14 (EC, CC and EC + CC); participants were confined for the duration of the study. Authors report
between-group differences and breakdown into two separate samples (studies 1 and 2). Study 1 has the larger sample size so is included in Table 1. Study 2
found consistent directions of effect for all markers. Pulvers et al. [13] assigned all participants to EC and reports median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for
a number of toxic exposures across three groups at 4 weeks: people who switched to EC for at least the first 2 weeks (n = 10); people who switched
exclusively for the full 4 weeks (n = 6); and people who used both EC and CC throughout the entire 4-week period (n = 21). The latter two groups are

values at follow-up only, we used these data and subgrouped by absolute values versus change, as recommended by Cochrane. We
assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic; where this was
above 75%, we considered effect direction when deciding appropriateness of reporting pooled estimates. For outcomes and comparisons
where heterogeneity or issues with study reporting precluded metaanalyses, we synthesized results using effect direction plots, where
possible. For all other instances, we reported results narratively.

RE SU LT S
Of the 49 studies measuring at least one biomarker of exposure identified via our parent Cochrane review, seven provided data relevant to
these analyses, together with two new studies identified following
publication of the parent review [5, 6]. In total, we include nine studies (n = 1299) in our syntheses (see Table 2 for summary, see
Cochrane review for full characteristics [4] and see the Supporting
information for flow diagram).

Carbon monoxide
Seven studies provided data on CO. Four of these provided data on
eCO which could be meta-analysed (Figs 1–3). In pooled analyses,
eCO was lower in the EC group than in the dual use or CC groups,
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) excluding no difference in the
comparison with CC. eCO was also statistically significantly lower
when comparing dual use to CC only (Fig. 3). In all cases, I 2 indicated
substantial statistical heterogeneity, but this was driven by magnitude

Kerr 2020 was the only study to provide data on abstainers; eCO
levels at 12 weeks were the same between the EC group (n = 16) and
abstainers (n = 12), at 1 part per million (p.p.m.) [standard deviation
(SD) = 1 in both groups] [5]. Abstainers had statistically significantly
lower eCO at 12 weeks than the CC group (n = 3) [mean difference
(MD) = −18.00 p.p.m., 95% CI = –24.81 to −11.19; analysis not
shown).
Cobb et al. reported linear mixed effects models investigating
product exposure variables [7]. They reported no statistically significant association between times ECs were used and eCO and a statistically significant positive association between eCO and cigarettes per
day, at both 1 and 3 months (P < 0.02; data not reported). In Morris
et al. [6], all participants exclusively used EC at days 1–9 and were
subsequently randomized to three groups from days 10 to 14 (EC, CC
and dual use); participants were confined for the duration of the study
[6]. Authors reported between-group differences in percentage saturation of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb; a blood measure of CO): at day
14 (n = 14), levels were statistically significantly lower in EC compared
to both CC and dual-use [EC versus CC least squares (LS) MD =
−7.13, 95% CI −8.41 to −5.85; EC versus dual-use LS MD −2.56, 95%
CI −3.81 to −1.31]. Levels were also statistically significantly lower in
dual use compared to CC (LS MD −4.57, 95% CI −5.90 to −3.25).*

Background and aims: Behavioural smoking cessation trials have used comparators that
to account for variability in comparators, these relied on subsets of trials and incomplete
data on comparators. This study aimed to estimate the relative effectiveness of (individual) smoking cessation interventions while accounting for variability in comparators using
comprehensive data on experimental and comparator interventions.
Methods: A systematic review and meta-regression was conducted including

population and methods. Meta-regression was used to create a model predicting
smoking cessation outcomes. This model was used to re-estimate intervention effects,
as if all interventions have been evaluated against the same comparators. Outcome
measures included log odds of smoking cessation for the meta-regression models and
smoking cessation differences and ratios to compare relative effectiveness.
Results: The meta-regression model predicted smoking cessation rates well (pseudo
R2 = 0.44). Standardising the comparator had substantial impact on conclusions regarding the (relative) effectiveness of trials and types of intervention. Compared with a ‘no
support comparator’, self-help was 1.33 times (95% CI = 1.16–1.49), brief physician
advice 1.61 times (95% CI = 1.31–1.90), nurse individual counselling 1.76 times (95%
CI = 1.62–1.90), psychologist individual counselling 2.04 times (95% CI = 1.95–2.15) and
group psychologist interventions 2.06 times (95% CI = 1.92–2.20) more effective.
Notably, more elaborate experimental interventions (e.g. psychologist counselling) were
typically compared with more elaborate comparators, masking their effectiveness.
Conclusions: Comparator variability and underreporting of comparators obscures the
interpretation, comparison and generalisability of behavioural smoking cessation trials.
Comparator variability should, therefore, be taken into account when interpreting and

Although the final model (Table 3) is based on trials evaluating in-person
delivered interventions so that exposure time can be included, the active
content estimates fall well within the 95% CI of the model for written
interventions (Tables SB2 and SB3). We, therefore, used the final
in-person delivery model to also re-estimate the effects for written
interventions. Below, we compare trials’ reported effect size with seven

The patterns are very similar to those reported in the previous
paragraph: the reported effect sizes give a distorted image of the
relative effectiveness of intervention prototypes because of variability
in the comparators used. For example, when using the average

conclusions one would draw when examining the reported effect sizes
(right panel, Figure 4). An overview of these ratio estimates can be
found in Table 5.

DI SCU SSION
The results demonstrate that variability and underreporting of comparators obscure the interpretation, comparison and generalisability
of behavioural smoking cessation trials. When we re-estimate the
effectiveness of individual trials against standardised comparators, or
the (relative) effectiveness of prototypical interventions, conclusions
about which interventions appear most effective change considerably.
First, when accounting for variability in comparators, trials that based
on their reported results appear to be the most effective in their
category (e.g. individual nurse counselling interventions) can be among
the least effective when variability in comparators is accounted for.
Second, experimental groups receiving simple, brief interventions
appear worse off than comparator groups in trials evaluating more
elaborate, intensive interventions; and vice versa, more complex interventions that appear of limited use based on their reported effects

F I G U R E 4 Aggregated predicted cessation rate differences for the five prototypes of experimental interventions using the average reported
active content that comparator groups within each of the trials including these prototypical experimental interventions actually used. For
example, for all trials including self-help as an experimental group, the average reported active content of the comparator groups actually used in
these studies was calculated (total number of behaviour change techniques, medication and exposure time). These average values were then used
to predict cessation rates of the comparator groups for all trials using self-help interventions as experimental group. Afterwards, the difference in
the predicted cessation rates of the experimental and comparator groups was calculated. The same was done for the other prototypes of
experimental interventions. The plot illustrates the predicted cessation rate difference between experimental and comparator groups without
standardising comparator groups, but rather using the characteristics of comparator groups that were actually used within each cluster of
prototypical experimental interventions. Note, the black line within each box represents the median.

Abstract
Tobacco smoking is highly prevalent among patients with serious mental illness (SMI), with
known deleterious consequences. Smoking cessation is therefore a prioritary public health
challenge in SMI. In recent years, several smoking cessation digital interventions have been
developed for non-clinical populations. However, their impact in patients with SMI remains
uncertain. We conducted a systematic review to describe and evaluate effectiveness, acceptability, adherence, usability and safety of digital interventions for smoking cessation in
patients with SMI. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychINFO
and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register were searched. Studies
matching inclusion criteria were included and their information systematically extracted by
independent investigators. Thirteen articles were included, which reported data on nine different digital interventions. Intervention theoretical approaches ranged from mobile contingency management to mindfulness. Outcome measures varied widely between studies. The
highest abstinence rates were found for mSMART MIND (7-day point-prevalent abstinence:
16–40%). Let’s Talk About Quitting Smoking reported greater acceptability ratings, although
this was not evaluated with standardized measures. Regarding usability, Learn to Quit showed
the highest System Usability Scale scores [mean (S.D.) 85.2 (15.5)]. Adverse events were rare
and not systematically reported. Overall, the quality of the studies was fair to good.
Digitally delivered health interventions for smoking cessation show promise for improving
outcomes for patients with SMI, but lack of availability remains a concern. Larger trials
with harmonized assessment measures are needed to generate more definitive evidence and
specific recommendations.

Tobacco smoking kills more than 8 million people a year worldwide (World Health
Organization, 2019), making it the third highest risk factor for attributable disability-adjusted
life-years, surpassed only by child and maternal malnutrition and high systolic blood pressure
(Murray et al., 2020). Total global costs of tobacco smoking are estimated around USD 1432
billion, which represents 1.8% of global annual GDP (Goodchild, Nargis, & Tursan
d’Espaignet, 2018). In the US, tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death and disability
(Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021), with direct and indirect medical costs
exceeding USD 300 billion (US Department of Health Human Services, 2020; Xu, Bishop,
Kennedy, Simpson, & Pechacek, 2015).
The excess premature mortality associated with smoking can be mitigated by smoking cessation (Doll, Peto, Boreham, & Sutherland, 2004), but treatments are underutilized, and most
major clinical trials have excluded those with serious mental illness (SMI) (Cather, Pachas,
Cieslak, & Evins, 2017). Smoking rates have declined significantly over time among individuals
without mental illness, but changed only slightly among those with mental illness (Cook et al.,

https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172300123X Published online by Cambridge University Press

2014). More than half of individuals with schizophrenia spectrum
disorders smoke cigarettes, a rate three times that of the general
population (Sagud, Mihaljevic Peles, & Pivac, 2019; Šagud et al.,
2018). Smoking prevalence is also particularly high among
those with bipolar disorder (BD), who are two to three times
more likely to have started smoking and are less likely to initiate
and/or maintain smoking abstinence than individuals without
psychiatric disorders (Heffner, Strawn, DelBello, Strakowski, &
Anthenelli, 2011). Life expectancy for individuals with SMI is
reduced compared with the general population (Plana-Ripoll
et al., 2019), with tobacco accounting for a substantial portion
of total deaths among patients with schizophrenia or BD
(Callaghan et al., 2014).
Smoking cessation interventions would seem to be fundamental for improving life expectancy and quality of life in people with
SMI (Doll et al., 2004; World Health Organization, 2018).
However, mental health services are often unable to provide sufficient support for smoking cessation to patients (Bailey et al.,
2019), and staff attitudes about lack of usefulness of these strategies hinder the achievement of tobacco abstinence (Malone,
Harrison, & Daker-White, 2018). Furthermore, individuals with
SMI appear to have specific mediators/moderators of smoking
behavior and barriers to smoking cessation compared to the general population (Lum, Skelton, Wynne, & Bonevski, 2018; Moran,
Betts, Ongur, & Janes, 2018; Slyepchenko, Brunoni, McIntyre,
Quevedo, & Carvalho, 2016). Smoking cessation self-efficacy, or
confidence in one’s ability to quit, is a known predictor of cessation outcomes with lower cessation self-efficacy predicting higher
rates of relapse (Clyde, Pipe, Els, Reid, & Tulloch, 2017). Smokers
with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia commonly report
low cessation self-efficacy, along with low motivation to quit due
to a desire to better cope with symptoms, particularly cognitive
impairment and negative symptoms, as well as to reduce side
effects of antipsychotic treatment (Kumari & Postma, 2005;
Lum et al., 2018; Thornton et al., 2012). When schizophrenia
patients attempt to quit, some reports find exacerbation of executive functioning deficits, which may contribute to high rates of
smoking relapse (Tidey & Miller, 2015). In the case of BD, a substantial portion of patients report that they smoke to manage
symptoms of their mental illness, and smoking is associated
with greater severity of mood symptoms, comorbid psychiatric
and addictive disorders, and suicidality (Tidey & Miller, 2015).
Experimental evidence supports that nicotine can indeed influence symptoms in SMI (Featherstone & Siegel, 2015; Koukouli
et al., 2017; Kumari & Postma, 2005; Novak et al., 2010; Sabe,
Zhao, & Kaiser, 2020), as well as cognitive performance in schizophrenia, BD and major depressive disorder (MDD) (Barr et al.,
2008; Caldirola et al., 2013; Hong et al., 2011; Jubelt et al.,
2008; Levin, Wilson, Rose, & McEvoy, 1996; Smith, Singh,
Infante, Khandat, & Kloos, 2002; Smucny, Wylie, Kronberg,
Legget, & Tregellas, 2017). Other studies, however, limit the neurocognitive effects of nicotine only to schizophrenia (Morisano,
Wing, Sacco, Arenovich, & George, 2013).
Pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation in SMI
include bupropion and varenicline, as well as nicotine replacement therapies when necessary (Peckham, Brabyn, Cook, Tew,
& Gilbody, 2017). However, quit rates in SMI are low and relapse
rates are higher than in the general population (Brunette et al.,
2018b; Peckham et al., 2017). While psychosocial treatments
like cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and
contingency reinforcement have demonstrated short-term efficacy
in some trials, other studies have shown no effects (Baker et al.,

Luis Martinez Agulleiro et al.

2006; Cather et al., 2017; Gelkopf et al., 2012; Gold et al., 2018;
Lum et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2010). With the advance of
digital technologies and eHealth, several smoking cessation digital
interventions have been developed for use in non-psychiatric
population, although evidence regarding their efficacy shows
mixed results (Bricker, Watson, Mull, Sullivan, & Heffner, 2020;
Chulasai, Chinwong, Chinwong, Hall, & Vientong, 2021;
Garrison et al., 2020; Pbert et al., 2020; Peek et al., 2021).
Although digital interventions would seem to be particularly relevant for patients with SMI (Sawyer, Hassan, Guinart, Martinez
Agulleiro, & Firth, 2022), most major clinical trials have excluded
such patients (Cather et al., 2017), and most interventions have
not been assessed in properly powered clinical trials (Haskins,
Lesperance, Gibbons, & Boudreaux, 2017), have not included
behavior change techniques that have been shown to be effective
in smoking cessation interventions (Ubhi et al., 2016) or have not
been customized to match users’ personal characteristics
(Hoeppner et al., 2016). A recent narrative article has explored
the feasibility of smoking cessation apps in people with schizophrenia (Sawyer et al., 2022), and indicated that these interventions might represent a realistic alternative for the treatment of
nicotine use in patients with SMI. However, due to its narrative
nature, information on effectiveness, usability, and other relevant
outcomes was scarce and not systematically assessed.
Thus, the purpose of this review was to systematically describe
and evaluate the characteristics of digital interventions for smoking cessation validated in patients with SMI, namely
schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD), BD, and MDD. We
aimed to describe and evaluate (1) effectiveness, (2) acceptability
and adherence, (3) usability, and (4) safety of these interventions.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis
(PRISMA) guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, &
Group, 2009). The review protocol for this review was registered
in PROSPERO (CRD42021262481).
Literature search
We conducted a search of the electronic databases PubMed/
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane
Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, and PsycINFO
from database inception until 31 March 2022. Reference lists of
eligible studies were screened, but no other sources (including
unpublished studies) were sought. No restrictions on language
were applied. Published, full-text peer-reviewed articles reporting
the effectiveness, acceptability, adherence, usability and/or safety
of digital interventions for smoking cessation in patients with
SSD, BD, and/or MDD were included. Articles were excluded if:
(1) the study population was composed of patients with a primary
diagnosis different from SSD, BD and/or MDD; (2) the intervention was exclusively non-digital; (3) the intervention was not for
smoking cessation; and (4) the paper was an abstract, systematic
review, protocol, or poster communication. The search string
was designed to include any study reporting digital interventions
for smoking cessation in patients with SMI, as follows: (digital OR
app OR web OR ehealth OR mhealth OR smartphone) AND
((smoking OR tobacco) AND (cessation OR abstinence)) AND
(severe mental illness OR serious mental illness OR SMI OR
psychosis OR schizophrenia OR schizoaffective OR bipolar OR

mania OR major depressive disorder OR major depression OR
depression).
Study selection and data extraction
After initial search and removal of duplicates, each study was
independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers
(BP, LMA). If a study was deemed relevant by at least one
reviewer, or in case of doubt, the full-text article was retrieved
and examined in depth for eligibility. Differences in search and
selection results were discussed and when consensus was not
reached, a third reviewer (DG) was consulted.
Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers
(BP, LMA) using a template developed for this systematic review
including the following characteristics and data: (1) article design
and characteristics: first author, year, country, study design, primary
and secondary outcomes, comparators; (2) characteristics of the
digital intervention: name, type (smartphone app, web), device
(smartphone, cellphone, laptop, computer), cost, theoretical
approach, duration; (3) sample characteristics: eligibility criteria,
sample size, diagnosis, age, sex, race, illness duration, setting
(inpatient and/or outpatient), symptom severity, pattern of tobacco
use and severity of nicotine dependence; and (4) results of the intervention: effectiveness, acceptability, adherence, usability, and safety.
Data on effectiveness of the intervention were extracted
according to study-defined criteria as any smoking reduction
and/or abstinence/cessation, measured either as self-report,

https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172300123X Published online by Cambridge University Press

structured/semi-structured interviews, or expired carbon monoxide (CO). Acceptability, adherence and usability were extracted
using the quantitative instruments reported in the study.
Additionally, qualitative results on acceptability and usability
were extracted and summarized from available articles. Safety of
the intervention was extracted if the publication reported the
onset of adverse events (AEs) during the trial.
Study quality was evaluated using the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI) Study Quality Assessment Tools for
Controlled Interventions and Before-After (Pre-Post) Studies
With No Control Group (National Institutes of Health, 2021). As
most digital interventions were not accessible online to be fully evaluated with the Adapted Mobile App Rating Scale (A-MARS)
(Stoyanov et al., 2015), we used author-reported information whenever possible (see online Supplementary Table S3). For the two
interventions that were available (QuitGuide and quitStart), ratings
reflect the assessment made independently and agreed upon by the
investigators (BP, LMA) while using the apps.
Results
The search retrieved 2214 articles. After duplicates were removed,
1419 unique studies were screened and 1388 were excluded. A
full-text review of 31 articles was conducted, and finally 13 articles
were included in this review. The inter-rater agreement was
98.5% [95% CI (97.6–99.0)]. The study selection process is presented as a PRISMA flow diagram in Fig. 1. A detailed summary

of the characteristics of the included articles can be found in
Table 1.
The 13 included articles covered 9 different digital interventions. All included articles were published after 2011 and pertain
to five distinct research groups. The number of articles studying
each digital intervention ranged from 1 to 3. Six articles used controlled trial methods to study the digital intervention, while the
rest used quasi-experimental and prospective designs. All samples
were of outpatients with sample size ranging from n = 5
(Vilardaga et al., 2016) to n = 162 (Brunette et al., 2020). SSD
was the most common diagnosis, followed by BD and MDD
(Table 1).
General characteristics of the included digital interventions
Nine unique digital interventions for smoking cessation were
identified in this systematic review. At the time this review
was conducted, only two (QuitGuide and quitStart) were commercially available and readily accessible via App Store and
Google Play, all of them in English with no alternative language
option. The remaining seven interventions were not accessible
for evaluation and data were obtained from associated publications or directly from the authors whenever possible (See
Table 2 for detailed description of the interventions). Briefly,
six interventions were delivered as smartphone-based apps,
and three were computer-based. The theoretical foundations
of the digital interventions range from acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011) to theory
of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), mindfulness (Quaglia,
Brown, Lindsay, Creswell, & Goodman, 2015), and contingency
management (CM) (Petry, 2011). The specific interventions
were as follows:
(1) iCOMMIT is a behavioral therapy-based smartphone-based
app, which includes mobile CM (mCM). Additionally, the
full intervention includes five cognitive-behavioral counseling
sessions with a therapist. For the digital part of the intervention, participants are asked to self-record a video of themselves blowing into a handheld CO monitor to confirm
smoking abstinence and upload it onto the secure website
linked to the app. The website then analyses the CO monitor
reading in the video and translates that information to deliver
financial reinforcement through the app (Medenblik et al.,
2020).
(2) Learn To Quit is a smartphone-based app based on ACT and
specifically developed for patients with SMI following a usercentered design (Vilardaga et al., 2018). Notably, it is the only
included intervention who was developed in co-production
with patients with SMI. It focuses on three processes of
change: creating awareness of experienced smoking urges,
openness to that experience, and committing to quitting
smoking through specific values. Learn To Quit uses simple
screens and large buttons, gamification and prioritizing visual
engagement among other features to minimize usability challenges in people with SMI. It also implements a tracking
option for daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA)
of mood, number of cigarettes smoked, tobacco craving,
and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use (Vilardaga
et al., 2019, 2020).
(3) Let’s Talk About Quitting Smoking is a web-based intervention focused on Theory of Planned Behavior. It comprises

Luis Martinez Agulleiro et al.

perceived behavioral control for smoking and cessation treatment. It includes 48 interactive sessions that encourage the
user to enlist reasons for smoking and track smoking related
activities, practice coping skills, or learn about NRT and other
medications, among others. The interface was designed to
minimize reliance on cognitive functions to improve usability
in patients with SMI (Brunette et al., 2019).
Let’s Talk About Smoking is web-based motivational decision
support system designed to increase motivation to quit. This
program can be completed over a single sitting within 30–60
min. It includes a video program host who guides the participants through three modules to assist decision making about
cessation treatment options. The program was tailored for
people with cognitive deficits to ensure ease of use
(Brunette et al., 2020).
mSMART MIND is a smartphone-assisted intervention based
on mindfulness and CM. The intervention encourages mindfulness practices, incorporates EMA and uses a progressive
mCM payment schedule through videos with a handheld
CO monitor showing expired CO levels which are uploaded
until 14 days after the set quit date (Minami et al., 2018).
QuitGuide, QuitPal, and quitStart are smartphone-based apps
developed by the US National Cancer Institute based on different clinical practice guidelines for smoking cessation.
QuitGuide is aimed toward the adult population, the app
monitors behaviors and mood associated with quitting smoking, enhances motivation to maintain abstinence and helps
patients setting a quit date. The intervention includes psychoeducation, tracking smoking habits and tips for quitting.
QuitPal allows setting a quit date, daily tracking of smoking
and mood, and allows users to log smoke-free days if the individual has been smoke-free for an entire day. The app allows
for customized reminders, saving goals, and provides graphs
of the progress (Vilardaga et al., 2016). quitStart was
designed to target the teenage population. It encourages
the user to set a quit date, provides education on smoking
cessation strategies with interactive swipable cards, and
allows for daily tracking of information. Additionally, it
offers distraction games to aid with smoking craving. The
app automatically sends check-in notifications to ask the
user for the number of cigarettes smoked since the last
check-in.
WebQuit Plus is a web-based intervention based on ACT,
built on the WebQuit Plus program (Bricker, Mull,
McClure, Watson, & Heffner, 2018). This program has four
sequential components to help the user by making a quit
plan, developing awareness and coping skills of triggers,
and supporting long-term abstinence by engaging personal
values and self-compassion. WebQuit Plus adds to the ACT
program exercises to tackle specific challenges to smoking
cessation, testimonials, and one- and two-way messaging to
promote adherence to NRT and assistance with moodspecific triggers. It also uses tracking data to display money
and minutes saved via reducing or quitting smoking on the
main dashboard (Heffner et al., 2020).

Effectiveness
The definition of effectiveness varied widely among the different
articles. The most frequently used definition was point-prevalent
abstinence (PPA), either at 7 or 30 days, measured either as self-

https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172300123X Published online by Cambridge University Press

report or confirmed with expired CO. Abstinence rates ranged
between 9 and 40%, with varying comparison groups. The highest
abstinence rates were found for mSMART MIND, with biochemically verified 7-day PPA abstinence rates of 40% at 2 weeks after
end of treatment (EOT), and 16% at 3 months post-EOT (Minami
et al., 2022). Similar rates were found in iCOMMIT, with 7-day
self-reported PPA at EOT of 38–40% for the successive cohort
design (Wilson et al., 2019), but 9.5–19.0% for the pilot RCT
trial (Medenblik et al., 2020). Other definitions of effectiveness
used included reduction of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD),
engagement in smoking cessation behavior, and smoking cessation knowledge. Vilardaga et al. (2020) found that Learn to
Quit led to a significant greater reduction in CPD than the comparator (QuitGuide), and iCOMMIT was found to reduce CPD,
although significant reductions were only reported for patients
with BD. Regarding engagement in smoking cessation behavior
(e.g.: seek counsel, start smoking cessation medication, enroll in
support groups), the interventions did not seem to outperform
their comparators. In this regard, Brunette et al. (2011);
Brunette et al. (2018a) and Brunette et al. (2020) reported inconsistent evidence for the effect of Let’s Talk About Smoking, and
Heffner et al. (2020) and Vilardaga et al. (2020) did not find differences in NRT use between groups for WebQuit Plus and Learn
to Quit, respectively. Finally, iCOMMIT was not found to improve
smoking cessation knowledge (Medenblik et al., 2020). Detailed
information regarding effectiveness can be found in Table 2.
Acceptability and adherence
In the nascent field of digital health, the definitions of acceptability and adherence are oftentimes blurred and overlapped. For the
purpose of this review, we report acceptability as the willingness
and satisfaction to use a digital intervention (Nadal, Sas, &
Doherty, 2020), and adherence as the degree to which patients
are able to use the digital intervention as indicated by the research
protocol.
Acceptability was reported only for three interventions (Let’s
Talk About Quitting Smoking, Let’s Talk About Smoking, and
WebQuit Plus). Across studies, acceptability was evaluated with
author-developed scales rather than standardized measures. For
Let’s Talk About Quitting Smoking (Brunette et al., 2019), 87%
of the sessions were rated ⩾3 on a 4-point Likert scale, and
85% of participants gave a positive response when interrogated
about the intervention. Similarly, Let’s Talk About Smoking was
found to be easier to understand and to have a higher satisfaction
rate than its comparator (Brunette et al., 2018a). For mSMART
MIND, satisfaction was measured on a 5-point Likert scale, and the
intervention was found ‘enjoyable’ (author-reported score: 4.6/5)
and ‘helpful’ (author-reported score: 4.7–4.9/5) (Minami et al.,
2018, 2022). WebQuit Plus outperformed its comparator
(Smokefree.gov) in satisfaction and perceived usefulness, but not in
other items (such as usefulness of the plans for quitting or the support
forum, site organization or accessibility) (Heffner et al., 2020).
Additionally, three articles (Gowarty, Aschbrenner, &
Brunette, 2021; Vilardaga et al., 2016, 2019) used semi-structured
qualitative interviews to measure acceptability. Patients showed
positive attitudes and high levels of acceptability for QuitGuide
and quitSTART, emphasizing the motivational content
(Gowarty et al., 2021). QuitPal was found to be excessively
focused on quitting smoking, and that a shift toward reducing
tobacco use would be preferable (Vilardaga et al., 2016). Finally,
patients found Learn to Quit to be more engaging than

Psychological Medicine

QuitGuide, pointing out the use of gamification to boost engagement (Vilardaga et al., 2019). In general, the most remarkable features of the interventions were cigarette tracking, aids to avoid
craving and monetary incentives (Gowarty et al., 2021;
Vilardaga et al., 2016, 2019).
Adherence was reported for two interventions (iCOMMIT, and
mSMART MIND). The intervention iCOMMIT was reported to
have an adherence rate of 40–63% over the 4-week period of
the trial (Wilson et al., 2019). Adherence, considered as percentage of videos uploaded as part of the mCM intervention, was
reported to be 66.2–68.0% of the total requested videos
(Minami et al., 2018, 2022). Relevant information regarding
acceptability and adherence of the reviewed digital interventions
can be found in Table 2.
Usability
Five articles applied the System Usability Scale (SUS) to measure
usability of four different digital interventions (Gowarty et al.,
2021; Vilardaga et al., 2016, 2020, 2019). This 10-item scale provides a reliable measure of usability, with scores higher than 68
considered ‘above average’ (Brooke, 1996). The highest score
was found for Learn to Quit (85.2 ± 15.5), while the lowest was
reported for QuitPal (65.5 ± 18.6). In addition, Vilardaga et al.,
(2019) reported statistically significant higher SUS scores for
Learn to Quit than its comparator (QuitGuide); and in a different
article (Vilardaga et al., 2016), they found that patients with SMI
found QuitPal challenging to use due to its layer structure.
Heffner et al. (2020), found no differences between intervention
and control groups for number of logins, number of unique
login days or total number of days in use. Noteworthy, it was
reported that none of the participants accessed the section
where most of the content targeted to smokers with BD was
located.
Additionally, three articles (Vilardaga et al., 2016, 2019;
Wilson et al., 2019) used semi-structured qualitative interviews
to measure usability. Using a think-aloud approach, users of
QuitPal found obstacles to use several components of the app
(e.g.: enter information, pull up the keypad, navigate through several layers), which ultimately required direct guidance (Vilardaga
et al., 2016). Learn to Quit was found easier to use than QuitGuide
(Vilardaga et al., 2019). Finally, Wilson et al. (2019) report that
initiating CO readings was the main hurdle while using
iCOMMIT. Relevant information regarding usability of the
reviewed digital interventions can be found in Table 2.
Safety
AEs were reported only for five digital interventions (Learn to
Quit, Let’s Talk About Quitting Smoking, Let’s Talk About
Smoking, mSMART MIND, and WebQuit Plus) in six articles
(Brunette et al., 2019, 2020; Heffner et al., 2020; Minami et al.,
2018; Vilardaga et al., 2020, 2019), although standardized assessments were not used. Most of the interventions were found to be
safe, and no AEs were reported for Let’s Talk About Smoking
(Brunette et al., 2020) and mSMART MIND (Minami et al., 2018).
For Learn to Quit, Vilardaga et al. (Vilardaga et al., 2019,
2020) found no differences for ‘related’ or ‘possibly related’ AEs
between intervention and control groups, with 87% of these
AEs being linked to NRT use. Additionally, PANSS general psychopathology scores remained stable (pre- v. post-intervention:
40 v. 32, no p values reported), and although one participant

https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172300123X Published online by Cambridge University Press

was hospitalized due to an unrelated psychiatric event, no serious
AEs (SAEs) were found. One participant complained of increased
paranoia with Let’s Talk About Quitting Smoking (Brunette et al.,
2019). During the WebQuit Plus trial, Heffner et al. (2020)
reported 18 AEs, of which nine were classified as SAEs. Five
unique patients (two on the WebQuit Plus arm, and three on
the control arm) reported seven SAEs that were characterized as
psychiatric, but only one of these was deemed to have a potential
relationship to the intervention. The remaining AEs were considered to be related to nicotine withdrawal symptoms or adverse
effects of NRT use. In addition, depression and mania scores
remained stable throughout the trial. Finally, Wilson et al.
(2019) did not report any medication-related AEs with
iCOMMIT, although no information was available for the digital
component of this intervention. An overview of the safety of the
interventions can be found on Table 2.
Quality assessment
Overall, quality of the studies was ‘fair’ to ‘good’ as assessed with
the NHLBI Study Quality Assessment Tools, although with limitations inherent to the experimental or pilot nature of most of
the studies. Inter-rater agreement for quality assessment was
90.0% [95% CI (55.5–99.7)]. Studies showed high adherence to
protocol and methods, with few drop-outs from the trials.
However, blinding and sample size were found the main concerns
when rating quality (see online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2
for detailed NHLBI assessments).
Digital interventions were evaluated using specific items of the
A-MARS. In this regard, quitStart showed the greatest scores,
mostly due to its highly user-friendly interface, with high ratings
for engagement and functionality aspects. By contrast, iCOMMIT
was deemed the lowest since the digital component of the intervention was mostly limited to mCM. Overall, the digital interventions showed good results in items of ‘interest’, ‘ease of use’ and
‘goals’, with lower ratings for addressing ‘multiple health issues/
symptoms’ and ‘real-time tracking’. See online Supplementary
Table S3 for detailed A-MARS ratings.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of digital
interventions for smoking cessation in patients with SMI. We
found nine different digital interventions that were assessed in
patients with SSD, BD, and MDD. First, the highest abstinence
rates (measured as 7-day PPA) were found with mSMART
MIND and iCOMMIT, two smartphone-based apps developed
on the basis of mCM. In this regard, mSMART MIND seemed
to be especially beneficial for patients with BD, showing a significant improvement in abstinence rates when compared with
enhanced standard treatment without mCM (aOR = 8.12, 95%
CI 1.42–46.6, p = 0.019). Additionally, mSMART MIND showed
the greatest CPD reduction (79.4% at 2 weeks after EOT, decreasing to 61.4% at 3 months), followed by iCOMMIT and Learn to
Quit. Results on motivation enhancement and improvement of
smoking cessation knowledge do not support the use of the
reviewed digital interventions for these purposes. Participants
reported high acceptability rates for Let’s Talk About Quitting
Smoking, Let’s Talk About Smoking, iCOMMIT, mSMART
MIND and WebQuit Plus, and in the case of Let’s Talk About
Smoking and WebQuit Plus, acceptability measures outperformed
those of the comparators. However, adherence rates to the

10

interventions were low (40–68%). The highest usability score was
found for Learn to Quit (SUS = 83.1–85.2%), which also was
reported to be significantly better, in terms of usability, than
QuitGuide. This seems in accordance with its user-centered
design since the early phases of development, which allowed to
tailor the intervention to patients with SMI. Results on qualitative
measures were found to be similar to quantitative approaches,
stressing the strength of using multiple methodologies when
studying digital interventions. Finally, safety was reported for
only five interventions, but broadly, the interventions were safe
to use, and no psychopathological decompensations were
reported while carrying out the trials. No AEs were reported for
Let’s Talk About Smoking or mSMART MIND, and in sum,
only WebQuit Plus reported one psychiatric SAE that could
potentially be related to the intervention.
In general, these findings suggest that digital interventions
represent a suitable and promising alternative to promote smoking cessation in patients with SMI, although larger RCTs are
clearly needed. Overall results are in line with similar reviews of
digital interventions for smoking cessation in patients without
SMI. Regmi, Kassim, Ahmad, and Tuah (2017) reported an
improvement in quitting rates among smokers, although it was
lower than in our findings (13–24%). This might be explained
by the fact that in their review, most of the subjects were recruited
through social media signs and advertisement. This could bias the
recruitment: taking on less motivated subjects than the clinical
populations included in the articles of our review may lessen quitting rates. In a 2019 update of their review, the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group found discouraging results for smoking cessation smartphone apps, reporting no evidence of benefit of these
digital interventions for smoking cessation (Whittaker et al., 2019).
Again, recruitment methods (online, through app stores) and
the use of non-clinical populations might explain the discrepancies with our findings. The quality of the studies conducted on
non-SMI population was deemed below average by the recent
reviews on the matter (Chu et al., 2021; Regmi et al., 2017;
Whittaker et al., 2019), and authors agreed on the need for
more uniformity when conducting trials in this field. Using less
stringent criteria due to the exploratory purpose of most of the
included studies in our review, we found that the quality of the
studies was fair to good, although more robust methodology is
needed in order to be able to generalize these results and provide
specific recommendations.
In the addiction field more broadly, some reviews have also
found optimistic results on the use of digital medicine approaches
for the treatment of methamphetamine (Rubenis, Baker, &
Arunogiri, 2021) and alcohol (Colbert, Thornton, & Richmond,
2020) use disorders, albeit a nascent field, and methodological
quality remains a significant barrier. Comparable results in
terms of efficacy and acceptability were found in other areas of
healthcare, such as cardiac rehabilitation (Wongvibulsin et al.,
2021) or maternal health and pregnancy (DeNicola et al., 2020;
Overdijkink et al., 2018), indicating the meaningful opportunity
for digital medicine while highlighting the need for larger and
methodologically comparable studies.
The results from this review should be interpreted with caution. Due to the different methodologies and ways of reporting
effectiveness, acceptability, usability and safety, we are unable to
provide a definite recommendation on which specific digital
intervention should be used in clinical practice. Additionally,
the relatively small number of participants in each study hinders
the possibility of performing an adequately powered

https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172300123X Published online by Cambridge University Press

Luis Martinez Agulleiro et al.

meta-analysis of the results. While mSMART MIND and
iCOMMIT seem to be the most effective interventions in terms
of abstinence, they are not available for public use in the most
common operating systems, which deems its immediate application impossible. It is also important to note that although this
review identified a total of nine digital smoking cessations trialed
in SMI, only two of these (QuitGuide and quitStart) are readily
available online, which showed poorer results in terms of effectiveness and have not been assessed as thoroughly as mSMART
MIND and iCOMMIT for acceptability and safety. The general
inaccessibility of evidence-based digital interventions for SMI is
a problem which extends far beyond smoking cessation, with a
recent review finding that only ∼15% of apps trialing in schizophrenia are currently available online (Kwon, Firth, Joshi, &
Torous, 2022). Clearly, further work is needed to improve the dissemination of effective digital approaches into the public sphere
more generally.
In terms of effective strategies for smoking cessation in SMI,
the results reported by both mSMART MIND and iCOMMIT
appear to indicate that mCM could be the most effective
approach. Nonetheless, future trials in this field should report
standardized measures that allow a comprehensive comparison
of effectiveness among different strategies, particularly because
delivery of cash monetary reinforcement might be challenging
in many settings (e.g.: public health systems, private practices),
whereas a digitally delivered reinforcement may easily overcome
such limitations. Moreover, results from the Learn to Quit and
WebQuit Plus trials highlight the need for simplified interfaces
to improve acceptability and usability in SMI. In this regard,
the idiosyncrasies of patients with SSD, BD, and MDD must be
considered, and research efforts targeted to each individual disorder must be developed. For instance, nicotine has been reported
to affect neurocognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia, but not in patients with BD and MDD (Morisano et al.,
2013). Also, patients with SSD exhibit impaired cognitive performance (Green, Kern, Braff, & Mintz, 2000; Mallet et al., 2022), which
might impact their ability to use digital interventions. Considering
this, patients with SSD might face harder cognitive challenges than
patients with BD and MDD when quitting smoking, and thus interventions tailored to their ability might be necessary.
Another limitation when considering the results of this review is
that all the digital interventions were studied in the US and in stable
outpatients, which may limit the generizability of the results to
other settings and patient populations. Given that most digital interventions were not readily available to be systematically evaluated
with a standardized evaluation scale, results from our assessments
should be cautiously considered. Further, reports of AEs in behavioral interventions were scarce and not systematically reported, in
contrast with other types of clinical trials, which could lead to the
misguided conclusion that non-pharmacological interventions are
without risk. As described in previous literature, AEs are also present in both psychotherapeutic and behavioral interventions and
should be systematically defined and reported to avoid harming
in other patients (Linden & Schermuly-Haupt, 2014). Finally, concerns regarding cybersecurity should be monitored in the future to
guarantee privacy and confidentiality to the users.
In conclusion, digital health appears to be a promising field to
develop and further validate interventions for smoking cessation,
which should also be tailored to patients with SMI. While some
interventions have shown positive preliminary data, more
research is needed to provide clinicians and patients with robust
recommendations to treat tobacco use with digital interventions.

Abstract: Smoking is one of the major public health challenges around the world. Traditional tobacco
control strategies, which include health education, taxes on tobacco products, and restrictions on smoking in
public spaces, have greatly contributed to the reduction of smoking behavior around the world. However,
these strategies are not enough to help smokers successfully quit smoking. Recent advances in applied
behavioral sciences provide new approaches for nudging smokers to quit smoking, this review reviewed

(Received 24 August 2011; final version received 10 December 2011)
This review presents a case study of Government policy in relation to behaviour
change and suggests ways of strengthening it by drawing on theoretical and
empirical approaches from health psychology. It aims to inform policy-makers
and politicians about the value of behavioural science, and to provide
psychologists with an example of engagement with Government. It is based on
two Health Psychology submissions to the 2010 UK House of Lords’ Science and
Technology Select Committee inquiry into Behaviour Change. The Inquiry
examined current knowledge about what interventions can effectively influence
behaviour, how behaviour change interventions can be used to achieve policy
goals and what factors should be taken into account by government in
determining whether a particular behaviour change intervention is appropriate.
The review critiques current UK Government thinking about behaviour change
and presents a number of linked frameworks for determining which behaviour
change interventions and policies it would be sensible to research and implement.
These include the COM-B system, a systems approach to understanding
behaviour in context; the PRIME Theory of motivation; the Behaviour Change
Wheel, including a comprehensive listing of intervention functions and policy
levers; and behaviour change techniques. We end with considerations of
intervention development, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

Introduction
In 2010, the UK House of Lords’ Science and Technology Select Committee
launched a wide-ranging inquiry into Behaviour Change and called for evidence from
the national and international scientific and policy communities and beyond (www.
parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/science-technology/behaviourchange/Cf
EBehaviourChange.pdf). To our knowledge, this is the first such exercise by any
national legislative body. The evidence was received by a panel of 12 peers with
expertise in science, ethics and policy; the expert advisor to the panel was a health
psychologist. Whilst the submissions could be on any aspect of behaviour change, the
great majority of the 150 or so submissions concerned health.
The context for the inquiry was as follows:
To meet many of the societal challenges we are currently facing  such as achieving an
80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 or reducing the burden on the health

service as a result of smoking, drinking or the rise in obesity  individual and collective
behaviour will need to change significantly . . .. The inquiry will examine our current
state of knowledge about what interventions can effectively influence behaviour, how
behaviour change interventions which have been designed on the basis of that
knowledge can be used to achieve policy goals, and what factors should be taken into
account by government in determining whether a particular behaviour change
intervention is appropriate.

The select committee set out to investigate, amongst other things, the policy
implications of recent developments in research on behaviour change, whether
current UK government behaviour change interventions are evidence-based and
subject to appropriate evaluation, the relationship between government, industry and
the voluntary sector in promoting behaviour change and the social and ethical issues
surrounding the use of behaviour change interventions by government. This article is
based on two health psychology submissions (Michie & West, 2010; West & Michie,
2010) one of which was invited as part of expert witness evidence to the Inquiry. It
addresses five of the 16 questions posed by the Inquiry: What is known about how
behaviour can be influenced? What should be classified as a behaviour change
intervention? How should different levels of intervention (individual, organisational,
community and national) and different types of intervention (legislative, fiscal,
educative) interact in order to achieve policy goals more effectively? Should
behaviour change interventions be used in isolation or in combination with other
policy interventions? What are the policy implications of recent developments in
research on behaviour change?
We begin this review with a critique of current UK Government thinking about
behaviour change and then propose an agenda for designing theory-based behaviour
change interventions of interest to policy-makers and for systematically developing
the science base and technology of behaviour change. This includes brief summaries of:
(1) The COM-B system: a systems approach to understanding behaviour in
context.
(2) The PRIME Theory of motivation which draws together into a single coherent
model the broad range of motivational processes, from drives and impulses to
analysis and self-conscious decision making.
(3) The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) which includes a comprehensive listing
of categories of intervention functions and the policy levers that may be used
to enact these.
(4) Taxonomies of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) which form the components of behaviour change interventions.
(5) We end with considerations of intervention development, effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness.

The UK Government’s approach to behaviour change
The UK coalition Government has declared its intention of avoiding coercive
interventions or those that impose ‘bureaucratic restrictions’ on individuals or
industry, and has established a ‘Behavioural Insight Team’ to help them achieve this.
Its work is illustrated in the following response to a House of Lords parliamentary
question (emphases ours):

Health Psychology Review

3

Asked by Lord Bassam of Brighton
To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many staff are employed in the Behavioural
Insight Team in the Cabinet Office; what are their terms of reference; to whom they
report; to whom they are accountable; and when they are expected to complete their
work programme. [HL3958]
Lord Taylor of Holbeach: ‘The Behavioural Insights Team has seven full-time staff.
Their terms of reference are to develop more cost-effective and less bureaucratic ways of
changing behaviour in ways that give citizens and communities greater control of their
own lives. They will achieve this in three ways. First, by proactively developing ideas for
achieving behavioural change using less bureaucratic methods across a wide range of
government policy and activity. In this mode the team will actively seek out areas where
behavioural science applications could be usefully applied. Secondly, by pursuing nonbureaucratic and non-coercive alternatives to regulation. And thirdly, by creating and
facilitating alliances and partnerships between government, business, media and the
third sector to deliver and activate the ideas developed above.’

The emphasis on the virtue of ‘non-bureaucratic’ (rather than, say, ‘effective’)
interventions reflects the Government’s underlying philosophy that eschews explicit
regulation and promotes behaviour change by more subtle means such as priming
and framing, social norm feedback, default options, incentivisation and environmental cues. The Behavioural Insight Team draws heavily on a book called ‘Nudge’:
Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness’ (Thaler & Sunstein,
2008). Common parlance includes ‘nudge thinking’, ‘nudge interventions’, ‘nudge
policies’ and even ‘nudge theory’. ‘Nudge’ is defined as ‘any aspect of the ‘choice
architecture’ that alters people’s behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding
any options or significantly changing their economic incentives’. This is put forward
as the ‘third way’ between libertarianism and paternalism. Libertarian paternalists
‘want to make it easy for people to go their own way; they do not want to burden
those who want to exercise their freedom’ (p. 5). .. . . ‘Libertarian paternalism is a
relatively weak, soft, and nonintrusive type of paternalism because choices are not
blocked, fenced off, or significantly burdened. If people want to smoke cigarettes, to
eat a lot of candy, to choose an unsuitable health care plan, or to fail to save for
retirement, libertarian paternalists will not force them to do otherwise  or even
make things hard for them’ (p. 6).
Eschewing other potentially more powerful interventions does not take into
account the conflicting interests in society: one person’s ‘freedom’ is another person’s
burden e.g. the ‘freedom’ to smoke extends the years of illness and disability for which
the smoker requires others to care for them; the ‘freedom’ to make potentially harmful
food attractive maximises profit for the food industry. Many large corporations have
no qualms about using more directive, coercive and powerful methods of shaping our
behaviours. The most striking example is cigarettes which besides containing an
addictive drug, nicotine, are engineered to maximise the impact of this drug in terms of
speed of delivery and potent conditioned stimuli (Rabinoff, Caskey, Rissling, & Park,
2007). Gaming machines use sophisticated operant conditioning techniques to
maximise behaviour rate. The food industry engineers its products, for example with
large amounts of hidden salt, to maximise immediate taste appeal (Magriplis et al.,
2011). The alcohol industry uses sophisticated marketing techniques tapping into core
aspects of identity to attract people to its products (Anderson, 2009).

4

S. Michie and R. West

The ‘nudge’ doctrine also discounts the duty of the state, in a democracy, to
protect its citizens from the harmful effects of such manipulation; protection may
require regulation, service provision, legislation and fiscal measures which research
findings have shown the public happy to accept (Bassi, 2010; Maryon-Davis & Jolley,
2010; YouGov, 2010).
Advocates of ‘nudge’ argue for a collaboration between government and the
market ‘to steer people’s choices in directions that will improve their lives’. Of note is
reference to the notion of choice rather than to behaviour. This is based on the
erroneous assumption that the behaviours that harm people’s health are exclusively
the result of choice, and that impulses driven by instinct and past associations that
do not involve reflective analysis do not play a significant role in shaping behaviour.
Thus, while the book makes much of cognitive biases, these are all considered to
work through a process of reflective option selection and not as part of the flow of
behaviour that is undertaken without self-awareness. Due weight is not given to the
powerful associative learning influences that interact with drives and emotions. An
example of the lack of attention to the role of context and impulse-driven motivation
in shaping behaviour is ‘in many cases, people make pretty bad decisions  decisions
they would not have made if they had paid full attention and possessed complete
information, unlimited cognitive abilities, and complete self-control’ (p. 6). Even if
people had all these resources and had made a decision to behave in a healthy
fashion, influences such as associative learning, widely used by the advertising
industry, will serve to push people off their chosen path.
A consideration of the effectiveness of ‘nudge interventions’ within the existing
UK public health environment that is shaped largely by industry suggests that the
evidence, where it exists, shows little or no effect (Marteau, Ogilvie, Roland, Suhrcke,
& Kelly, 2011).
The ‘nudge’ approach pre-judges the key issues that should be considered in
designing intervention strategy. Interventions need to be affordable, practicable and
publicly acceptable but if they are not effective these count for nothing. There is no
substitute for a rigorous evaluation of the evidence and a systematic analysis of the
behaviour in context in the light of that evidence. If a government turns its back on
interventions that evidence clearly shows are likely to be effective and which are
affordable, practicable and carry public support, and instead they back interventions
that derive from inconclusive evidence that is tangentially related to the behaviour at
issue but fits with a particular doctrine, human lives may be lost in their thousands.
Also missing is a consideration of the context of the harm posed by behaviour;
the central role that the notion of harm should play in intervention selection is
articulated by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in its Ladder of Interventions and
stewardship model (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2007). The ‘nudge’ approach
forswears ‘banning’ activities and yet no rational thinker could imagine that, were
cigarettes to be invented today, they should be permitted for sale. The fact that the
harms they cause were only discovered recently has led to an anomalous situation in
which governments concerned about public health have been forced to use other
interventions such as education and persuasion to limit that harm, and every attempt
to go further has been vigorously opposed by a hugely influential and wealthy
industry that uses the fact that its products are legal as a key defence.
The ‘nudge’ doctrine is not adequate to deal with the behaviour change challenges
facing society. It does not engage in a systematic analysis to determine likely

Health Psychology Review

intervention effectiveness, and allows political values to influence judgements about
other criteria such as effectiveness and public acceptability. The political values
underpinning adoption of the ‘nudge’ doctrine are revealed by the fact it is favoured
in cases where major industries, such as the alcohol and food industries, fear they
may lose business, but not in cases where there are no major industry stakeholders.
For example, the new stimulant drug ‘mephedrone’ was quickly banned even though
the harms to users and society appear to be substantially less than from tobacco or
alcohol. Coercive policies are also favoured with regard to getting people off sickness
and unemployment benefit and forcing drug-users by court order into treatment
programmes.
The arena of behaviour change where the Government favours ‘nudge’ is one that
does not involve a level playing field. Since industry can and does use interventions
that go well beyond ‘nudge’ to influence the behaviour of consumers, a socially
responsible behaviour change strategy needs to take account of the fact that all our
behaviours are subject to powerful manipulation by companies through marketing
and product design. The tobacco, gambling, ‘fast food’ and alcohol industries spend
many millions of pounds and dollars exploiting our psychology to sell their products.
If governments eschew interventions that protect us against this, ‘choices’ are not
free  they are dictated by commercial exploitation. An example of how industry uses
the vast resources at its disposal to influence consumer behaviour is Coca Cola’s
spend on advertising, estimated at $2.44 billion in 2009 (http://www.adbrands.net/us/

It may be noted that, like Odysseus who instructed the crew of his ship to tie him
to the mast and to block their own ears with wax so that they would not be lured by
the song of the sirens to steer the ship on to the rocks, the public will often support
coercive or restrictive interventions that prevent them succumbing to temptation. For
example, a large-scale survey of adults in Britain found that 77% supported getting
rid of cigarette vending machines completely, 73% wanted tobacco put out of sight in
shops and 67% supported banning TV advertising of junk food before 9 pm
(YouGov, 2010). There is also widespread approval even among smokers of the use of
tax increases as a way of curtailing smoking behaviour (Gardner & West, 2011) and
almost half the adult population of England would even support a total ban on sale
of cigarettes (Shahab & West, 2011).
‘Nudge’ is an ideologically driven doctrine, the application of which will result in
poor policy decisions with respect to health behaviour change. It should be replaced
with a systematic evidence-based approach to selecting interventions and determining policy. It is recognised that values should shape and constrain behavioural
interventions. The criticism of the ‘nudge’ doctrine is that it does so from a narrow
political perspective rather than a broader societal one. Thus it rules out
interventions that most members of society would be happy to accept if they were
explained. Rather than starting from a restricted range of intervention options,
Government should give systematic and comprehensive consideration to the range of
interventions that may be applicable to determine its behaviour change strategies. We
present such an approach aimed to be usable by psychologists and policy-makers
alike. The starting point is an analysis of the behaviour to be changed which
conceptualises behaviour as a system incorporating context (the COM-B system).
For example, understanding physical activity must take into account weather, local
geography and availability of facilities, and GP advice to stop smoking is very

6

different in contexts where GPs can provide free medication or refer to a behavioural
support programme than when these options are not available.
This analysis is linked to an evidence-based method for selecting amongst a
comprehensive, systematically organised and theoretically grounded range of
intervention options (the BCW). The selected interventions can, in turn, be linked
to specific BCTs and general policies to support their delivery in a way that is
sensitive to specific contexts.

A model of behaviour in context: the COM-B System
Applying the principle of parsimony, we sought to identify the simplest overarching
model needed to account for change in a behaviour. By behaviour, we mean ‘anything
a person does in response to internal or external events. Actions may be overt (motor
or verbal) and directly measurable, or covert (activities not viewable e.g. physiological responses) and indirectly measurable; behaviours are physical events that occur
in the body and are controlled by the brain’ (Hobbs, Campbell, Hildon, & Michie,
2011). We drew on two sources representing very different traditions: a US consensus
meeting of behavioural theorists in 1991 (Fishbein et al., 2001), and a principle of US
criminal law dating back many centuries. The former identified three factors that
were necessary and sufficient conditions for the performance of a specified volitional
behaviour: the skills necessary to perform the behaviour, a strong intention to
perform the behaviour and no environmental constraints that make it impossible to
perform the behaviour. In US criminal law, it is recognised that for a defendant to be
found guilty of a criminal act three conditions must be present: means/capability,
motive and opportunity (Means, motive, and opportunity, 2011). Logic dictates that
this can be extended to any action. This provides the starting point for a
comprehensive framework for understanding behaviour: as a system of interacting
elements as shown in Figure 1. The arrows represent potential for causal inference.
Thus, capability, motivation and opportunity are all necessary conditions for a given
behaviour, the behaviour can influence all three of these and capability and
opportunity can both influence motivation.
We can divide each of the sources of behaviour into two types. Capability can be
either physical (in the case of physical skills, physical strength, etc.) or psychological (in
the case of psychological resources and skills, knowledge, capacity for understanding

Figure 1. The COM-B system: a framework for understanding behaviour.

etc.). For motivation, reflective (involving self-conscious planning, analysis and
decision-making) and automatic processes (involving emotional reactions, drives and
habits) play a role. In the case of opportunity, it is possible to distinguish between what
is afforded by the physical environment (resources, locations, physical barriers, etc.)
and the social environment (concepts available in language, exposure to ideas, etc.).
This model provides a basis for specifying what drives and enables behaviour
patterns and individual behaviours. It is thus a model of behaviour per se, and
provides the basis for a model of behaviour change. It puts the nature of the
behaviour to be changed at its core: a COM-B analysis of the behaviour has direct
implications for the types of intervention likely to be effective. A systematic, theorybased approach to intervention design would be to identify the nature of the desired
change and then systematically consider each of the components that would be
necessary, practicable and acceptable to achieve that change.
In the case of health-related behaviour, it is apparent that motivation in its
broadest sense lies at its heart. Thus smokers are physically capable of not lighting
up, excessive drinkers are physically able to abstain and so on. Motivation is not
simply a matter of reflective choice; a COM-B analysis requires an understanding of
how reflective and automatic motivation interact to determine behaviour. There are a
number of models that have begun to explore this (e.g. Strack & Deutsch, 2004) but
one in particular explicitly seeks to bring together the full range of motivational
constructs into a single coherent model.
PRIME Theory of motivation
Motivation is central to the generation of behaviour. Given all the things that we are
capable of doing and that we have the opportunity to do, motivation determines
what we actually do and how we do it. Motivation goes beyond reason and choice to
all the psychological and physiological processes that energise and direct our
behaviour, including biological drives, emotions and habits (Mook, 1995). There has
been a tendency in recent years to focus on reflective aspects of motivation at the
expense of automatic aspects that have long been known to be important (Mook,
1995). Those that have focused on automatic processes have often not recognised
important distinctions within these processes (Keren & Schul, 2009). For example,
within operant conditioning there is evidence of an important distinction between
the learning of stimulus-impulse associations (habit) and associations between
stimuli and anticipation of pleasure or avoidance of discomfort (goal-directed
behaviour)(Skinner, 1953).
A comprehensive theory that represents the structure of human motivation as a
number of levels is PRIME Theory (West, 2006) (see Figure 2), with PRIME
standing for Plans, Responses, Impulses/inhibition, Motives and Evaluations.
According to this theory, ‘higher’ levels of motivation have evolved later than lower
levels and provide greater flexibility of response, but crucially are only able to
influence behaviour by acting as stimuli to lower levels. Higher levels of motivation
permit both greater flexibility of responding and anticipation of future events. Thus
reflex responses are the lowest level and simply involve organisation of a response in
response to a stimulus. Impulses and counter-impulses allow for immediate stimuli
with the strongest motivational force to control behaviour. Motives/desires allow for
goal-directed behaviour to the extent that possible futures can be imagined.

8

S. Michie and R. West

Figure 2. The structure of human motivation in PRIME Theory.
Note: Plans are self-conscious intentions to perform an action in the future. Beliefs are
propositions that are held to be true. Wants and needs are imagined futures to which are
attached anticipated pleasure/satisfaction and relief from mental or physical discomfort
respectively. Impulses are organised action schemas, and counter impulses are inhibitory
countervailing processes. Responses involve initiating, modifying or stopping an action. The
internal environment involves an ever-changing flux of emotional states, drive states, images
and cognitive schemata. The external environment involves stimuli impacting on the sense
organs. Reflective processes involve self-conscious information processing. Automatic
processes do not require conscious awareness although their results may be the object of
reflection and form part of ongoing experience.

Evaluations allow for goal-directed behaviour where goals can be communicated
through language and derived from inference and analysis. Plans allow for
behaviours to be deferred according to priorities or anticipated opportunity or
threat.
Thus what we believe to be good or bad can only influence our actions if our
beliefs make us want or need things at the relevant moment. Similarly, what we
intend to do at one time can only direct what we actually do if the intention is
remembered and generates sufficiently strong wants or needs in the moment to
overcome competing wants and needs from the immediate environment. In summary,
wants and needs compete at each moment for control over our actions and these are
under strong stimulus control as a result of past associative learning, and current
drives and emotional states.
Previous models of health-related behaviour have considered only a limited
number of ways in which change occurs. A great deal of attention is focused on
communication and inferential reasoning but associative learning is also crucial, as
are many other processes (see Table 1).
PRIME Theory notes that the motivational system is fundamentally ‘chaotic’
which means that small triggers can have large effects, and change can be sudden or
gradual or involve a long period of apparently random switching between states.
Approaches such as the ‘stages of change’ model that propose an orderly transition
in behaviour change, only account for a small proportion of instances of behaviour

change and can lead to inappropriate interventions (West, 2005). In the field of
smoking, for example, many smokers who appear not to be ready to stop will
respond favourably to an offer of help and will go on to become ex-smokers, contrary
to what would be expected from the ‘stages of change’ model (Pisinger, Vestbo,
Borch-Johnsen, & Jorgensen, 2005).
PRIME Theory further notes that, as a result of self-awareness, we as humans
develop mental representations of ourselves about which we have strong feelings.
These ‘identities’ are a very important source of wants and needs which give stability
to behaviour patterns; in many cases, a change in identity is a fundamental driver of
behaviour change. This has been cited as important in recovery from drug addiction
(White, 2004), and is cited as a major factor underlying spontaneous recovery and
forms part of the treatment approach offered by organisations such as Alcoholics
Anonymous which is widely used in many countries (Kaskutas, 2009). Self-control
involves a domination of reflective over automatic processes and this requires
psychological skills, mental energy (a finite resource) and efficient downward
connections between parts of the brain involved in reflective processes and the
automatic channels through which they must operate.
Thus, fundamental tenets of PRIME Theory are, first, that at every moment we
act in pursuit of what we most ‘want’ (anticipating pleasure or satisfaction) or ‘need’
(anticipating relief from mental or physical discomfort) at that moment. Second,
these are feelings and we do not have to verbalise them (even internally) for them to
influence our actions. Also, third, beliefs about what is good or bad and preformed
plans (reflective processes) can only influence our actions if they generate sufficiently
strong wants or needs at the relevant moment to overcome competing wants or needs
arising from more direct sources such as past associations and drive states. Our
identities are a very important source of wants and needs and can often be key to
achieving lasting behaviour change. Self-control is fundamental to much behaviour
change and to facilitate this it is necessary to develop psychological capabilities as
well as motivation to change, and to provide an environment conducive to this. Stress
and other psychological demands deplete reserves of mental energy and make it

10

S. Michie and R. West

harder for individuals to exercise self-control. The concept of mental energy has been
operationalised and studied, but as yet does not have a clear physiological substrate
and so can best be considered as a ‘metaphor’.
PRIME Theory provides a broad conceptualisation of motivation and its
influences that can help to develop interventions designed to change health-related
behaviours. Concepts developed in COM-B and PRIME Theory have been linked
with a comprehensive classification of intervention functions and policy categories to
form a theoretically based system for developing behaviour change interventions.
This is discussed in the following section.
A system for classifying interventions: the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW)
A behaviour change intervention is a co-ordinated set of activities designed to change
specified behaviour patterns. Usually these behaviour patterns are measured in terms
of the prevalence or incidence of particular behaviours in specified populations (e.g.
prevalence of tobacco smoking or incidence of delivery of brief advice from a
physician to stop smoking).
When designing or evaluating behaviour change interventions, one needs to begin
with a comprehensive analysis of what is driving the current behaviour pattern and
the available intervention and policy options. This requires an overarching model of
behaviour, and within that of human motivation, and a way of linking this to make a
selection from among the full panoply of intervention and policy options. This
approach contrasts with one which takes an idea, such as ‘nudge’ (Thaler & Sunstein,
2008) and attempts to apply it as a doctrine, thus neglecting all those intervention
strategies that come from a different perspective. It also contrasts with frameworks in
common use by the UK Government, such as MINDSPACE (Institute for
Government, 2010), that are not comprehensive in that they do not cover all
possible intervention types. Neither are they coherent in the sense of using categories
that are mutually exclusive and at similar conceptual levels.
We describe a classification system developed on the basis of a systematic review
of previous frameworks, with a clear goal of being (1) comprehensive, (2) coherent
and (3) based on an overarching model of behaviour (Michie, van Stralen, & West,
2011). It is a starting point for systematically developing the science base in this area
and a behaviour change technology.
The BCW takes the concepts developed in PRIME Theory and COM-B and
applies them to directing the choice of intervention functions and from there to
policy categories needed to enact those interventions. The distinction between
intervention functions and policy categories is illustrated by examples. A COM-B
analysis may determine that there is a requirement to educate particular sectors of
the population about the substantially increased risk of Type-II diabetes with even
moderate overweight. Thus, the intervention function is ‘education’. It then has to
determine what policies would be appropriate to deliver this. It may be ‘Communications/marketing’ (for example with a TV campaign), or ‘Service delivery’ (for
example, by primary healthcare staff giving brief advice to all patients who are
overweight). In a second example, consider that it is decided that an important
intervention function to reduce excessive alcohol consumption would be ‘environmental restructuring’ in which there was reduced exposure to certain kinds of
manipulative promotion by alcohol producers. Depending on the circumstances, it

Health Psychology Review

11

may be decided that this could be achieved through voluntary ‘regulation’ or it may
require ‘legislation’. A striking example of the difference between governmental
policies that have been largely evidence-based and derived from a comprehensive
analysis of the options and those that have been dominated by political ideology or
pandering to commercial interests is tobacco versus alcohol.
The BCW is marked out from other intervention classifications by its explicit
linkage to a comprehensive understanding of behaviour and motivation. It is also
marked out by the fact that the identification of intervention functions and policy
categories was arrived at by a systematic literature search for pre-existing classification
systems. This identified 19 frameworks of behaviour change (Michie, van Stralen, &
West, 2011). Such a comprehensive list is crucial because, unless intervention
designers and policy-makers can see the full set of options available for achieving
behaviour change, they are likely to overlook some that could be particularly
effective. An analysis of these frameworks revealed nine broad functions of
interventions and seven categories of supporting policies.
Merely listing the intervention and policy options can be useful as a reminder of
ones that would otherwise be missed. However, the BCW goes beyond that. It forms
the basis for a scientific analysis of how to make the selection. This is based on a
COM-B analysis of the target behaviour, along with key principles of likely
effectiveness, affordability, ethical acceptability, public acceptability and capacity
to be implemented within the current context.
The BCW classification system shows where doctrines such as ‘nudge’ fit within
the broad framework of behaviour change and the a-priori limits they impose on
intervention options. It also provides an analysis of the behaviour itself in relation to
the potential interventions and policies for change. The BCW is illustrated
diagrammatically in Figure 3 and definitions with examples are listed in Table 2.
An intervention strategy is a selection of intervention functions and policies to
enact or support these. Choice of intervention strategy only takes one so far in
attempting to change behaviour. Even the appropriate mix of intervention functions
is no guarantee of success. It is necessary to go to a more fine grained analysis of the
specific BCTs that make up the interventions.
Delivering interventions: behaviour change techniques (BCTs)
Each intervention function involves one or more specific BCTs. BCTs are irreducible
activities designed to achieve behaviour change (Michie, Abraham et al., 2011;
Michie, Johnston, Francis, Hardeman, & Eccles, 2008). Taxonomies of such
techniques that can be reliably used for specifying interventions have been developed
in relation to key behaviours related to health: smoking (Michie, Churchill, & West,
2011; Michie, Hyder, Walia, & West, 2011; West, Walia, Hyder, Shahab, & Michie,
2010), excessive alcohol use (Michie et al., in press), physical inactivity and unhealthy
eating (Abraham & Michie, 2008; Michie, Ashford et al., 2011; Michie et al., 2008).
Interventions may comprise many individual BCTs and the same BCT may be
evident across several interventions.
An example of applying an analysis of interventions based on BCTs comes from
the UK’s NHS Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT: www.ncsct.co.
uk), an academic-health service partnership. Analysing the enabling function of the
Stop-Smoking Services by BCT has identified the specific activities of its service

an analysis of behaviour.

provision that are associated with better success rates in their clients (West et al.,
2010). Out of 43 BCTs identified, a set of core ones were found to differentiate more
successful from less successful services (see Table 3). These cover the range of
processes described in PRIME Theory. For example, advising smokers on changing
their routines helps to avoid impulses to smoke in the presence of smoking cues.
Measuring expired-air carbon monoxide concentrations provides a strong image to
smokers of the harm from smoking and the immediate gains from stopping that
makes smokers feel positive about abstinence. Advising on stop smoking medications
allows smokers to make best use of those medications and so reduce the acquired
drive to smoke when nicotine concentrations in the brain are depleted and they
experience learned impulses to smoke. Helping smokers achieve an ex-smoker
identity enables them to put firm barriers around their behaviour so that smoking is
‘not an option’ at any time, just as it would be if they were in a supermarket. There is
much more work to be done on BCTs and their links with interventions and the
nature of the target behaviour, but a start has been made.
The BCW is currently being developed into a theory- and evidence-based tool
allowing a range of users to design and select interventions and policies according to
an analysis of the nature of the behaviour, the mechanisms that need to be changed in
order to bring about behaviour change, the interventions and policies required to
change those mechanisms and the BCTs required to deliver them.

Developing an effective intervention strategy
An effective ‘intervention strategy’ will involve a combination of intervention
functions, enacted using policies identified using criteria such as effectiveness, cost,

practicability and acceptability. Of these criteria, effectiveness is clearly a necessary
condition.
A crucial lesson from the accumulated evidence in many different areas is that
what is effective for a given behaviour, delivered in a particular way, in a given target
group and a given context may not be effective for other behaviours, target groups,
etc. The only way to be sure that a proposed intervention strategy in a given context
will be effective is to try it and evaluate it. The choice of strategy to implement
and evaluate should be based on the best available relevant evidence coupled with a
sound understanding of the underlying principles. A theoretical understanding of
behaviour and behaviour change, and previous research evaluating specific
interventions are crucial in designing intervention strategies that stand a better
chance of success, or in ruling out strategies that are unlikely to be effective (Craig
et al., 2008).
Using theory to design an intervention strategy is helpful and recommended
(Craig et al., 2008; Michie et al., 2008). This requires:
(1) an understanding of the nature of the behaviour to be changed and the
context. We have proposed a model that analyses the behaviour in terms of
‘capability’, ‘motivation’ and ‘opportunity’; these are necessary conditions for
the new behaviour pattern to emerge and point to where the deficiency
currently lies. This allows one to determine what needs to change in order for
the behavioural target to be achieved;
(2) a system for considering the full panoply of possible intervention functions
and identifying which are likely to be effective to bring about the necessary

Health Psychology Review

15

change identified above. Further details of this approach are available in
Michie et al. (2011b).;
(3) a method for designing the intervention strategy. Candidate intervention
functions are selected on the basis of the analysis at (i), and relevant evidence
of effective interventions and component BCTs. Relevant evidence should be
searched systematically rather than ‘cherry picked’.
When it comes to using previous research to design an intervention strategy, the
best starting point is to look for relevant systematic reviews. Two very good sources
for these in domains related to health are the Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com) and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
guidance documents (www.nice.org.uk). NICE has written generic guidance on
behaviour change interventions (Abraham, Kelly, West, & Michie, 2009; National
Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, 2007). Because it was constrained by its
brief not to go into specific examples, the guidance was necessarily general and could
be seen as promoting ‘motherhood and apple pie’. However, careful inspection of the
guidance will reveal important guiding principles that are rarely adopted in practice;
if they were, a great deal of public money would be saved on repeated promulgation
of ineffective intervention strategies.
There were 11 key psychological targets (which address both ‘reflective’ and
‘automatic’ aspects of human motivation) identified:
(1) Knowledge and outcome expectancies (helping people to develop accurate
knowledge about the health consequences of their behaviours).
(2) Personal relevance (emphasising the personal salience of health behaviours,
that is, what the consequences mean for individuals).
(3) Positive affective attitudes (promoting positive feelings towards the outcomes
of behaviour change).
(4) Descriptive norms (promoting the visibility of positive health behaviours in
people’s reference groups  that is, the groups they compare themselves with,
or aspire to).
(5) Subjective norms (enhancing social approval for positive health behaviours in
significant others and reference groups).
(6) Personal and moral norms (promoting personal and moral commitments to
behaviour change).
(7) Self-efficacy (enhancing people’s belief in their ability to change).
(8) Intention/goal setting and the formation of concrete plans (helping people to
form plans and goals in graded steps, over time and in specific contexts,
including making if-then plans and developing appropriate coping strategies).
(9) Behavioural contracts (inviting people to commit to their plans with others)
(10) Social relationships (helping people recognise how their social contexts and
relationships may affect their behaviour).
(11) Relapse prevention (helping people to develop skills to cope with difficult
situations and conflicting goals once they have initiated change).
A general conclusion of this NICE guidance was that the most effective interventions
were those that acted simultaneously at several levels. An example of integrating

16

different levels and types of intervention in relation to a policy goal following the
outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza is shown in Box 1.
Box 1: An example of interacting intervention levels
A systematic review of interventions to increase vaccination amongst health care
workers (Lam, Chambers, MacDougall, & McCarthy, 2010) investigated interventions in 12 randomised controlled trials and controlled before-and-after
studies published from 1992 to 2009. The interventions included education or
promotion (efforts to raise awareness and increase knowledge about influenza and
vaccination); improved access to vaccination (e.g. extended opening hours, mobile
vaccination); legislation or regulation (e.g. mandatory vaccination); measurement
and feedback where rates are tracked and then publicised; and role model work
where senior staff encourage vaccination.
The study found that in hospital settings, education campaigns and interventions to improve access resulted in only small increases in rates of uptake.
Campaigns involving more coercive components achieved higher rates of uptake.
In non-hospital health care settings, they concluded that a combination of
educational campaigns and improved access yielded greatest increases in uptake.
This nicely illustrates the importance of context in intervention effectiveness.
Evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness: importance to policy-makers
The House of Lords Inquiry asked for evidence of effective and ineffective behaviour
change interventions. It was evident from SM’s experience of being called as a
witness to the Inquiry that the members were dissatisfied with the quantity and
quality of the evidence contained within the large number of submissions they
received. They wanted ‘hard evidence’ of effective interventions that could be
recommended to Government. We used the BCW to structure the identification and
presentation of examples, emphasising that they are a small selection derived from a
very extensive evidence base. They address broad questions concerning the types of
intervention that can be effective; it must be stressed that the same type of
intervention can be delivered in many different ways and this would influence its
effectiveness. Implementation of evidence-based interventions across behaviour,
population and setting is not a mechanistic process and is underpinned by a recent
but rapidly developing science (see the journal Implementation Science).
There is an extensive evidence base on specific BCTs to apply within each of the
intervention functions specified in the BCW, and we provide a selection by way of
illustration:
(1) Education: provision of educational materials can increase uptake of cervical
cancer screening (Forbes, Jepson, & Martin-Hirsch, 2002).
(2) Persuasion: hard-hitting mass media campaigns can increase smoking
cessation rates (Bala, Strzeszynski, & Cahill, 2008); brief GP advice increases
smoking cessation rates (Stead, Bergson, & Lancaster, 2008); mass media
campaigns can have an immediate effect in increasing rate of HIV testing
(Vidanapathirana, Abramson, Forbes, & Fairley, 2005).

Health Psychology Review

17

(3) Incentives: vouchers for pregnant smokers to stop can increase smoking
cessation rates for the duration of the pregnancy (Heil et al., 2008; Higgins
et al., 2010).
(4) Coercion: increasing the price of alcohol and tobacco reduces consumption
(Babor et al., 2003); speed cameras and speeding fines reduce speeding and
vehicle crash rates (Wilson, Willis, Hendrikz, Le Brocque, & Bellamy, 2010);
random breath testing and driving bans reduce drink-driving and alcoholrelated death rates (Babor et al., 2003).
(5) Training: social skills training can reduce antisocial behaviour (Losel &
Beelmann, 2010); parenting training can reduce unintentional injury rates in
children (Kendrick, Barlow, Hampshire, Polnay, & Stewart-Brown, 2007).
(6) Restrictions: restricting availability, for example by reducing outlet density, has
been found to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol related harm
(Babor et al., 2003).
(7) Enablement: behavioural support and medications such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion and varenicline are effective in helping smokers to
stop (Cahill, Stead, & Lancaster, 2007; Hughes, Stead, & Lancaster, 2007;
Lancaster & Stead, 2005; Stead, Perera, Bullen, Mant, & Lancaster, 2008);
methadone maintenance treatment is effective in reducing criminal activity to
fund heroin use (Drugs and Public Policy Group, 2010); gastric banding
surgery reduces calorie intake and therefore obesity (Colquitt, Picot, Loveman, & Clegg, 2009).
(8) Modelling: hand-washing by senior role models can increase hand hygiene
behaviour of healthcare workers (Lankford et al., 2003).
(9) Environmental restructuring: prompts and reminders can improve health
professional management of diabetic patients (Renders et al., 2001).
The following examples of ineffective interventions are a small selection from a very
extensive evidence base. It must be remembered, however, that proving a negative is
impossible and when it comes to conclusions about intervention effectiveness with
regard to behaviour change it is more common to encounter statements of the kind
‘the evidence is too weak to support any firm conclusions’. Where the negative
evidence is strong we simply state the finding but where it is weaker we use phrases
such as ‘does not appear to’.
(1) Education: drug and alcohol education in schools has been found to be
ineffective (Babor et al., 2003; Drugs and Public Policy Group, 2010).
(2) Persuasion: school-based programmes including attempts at persuasion have
not been effective in reducing overeating in children (Summerbell et al., 2005);
public service announcements have proved ineffective in reducing excessive
alcohol consumption (Babor et al., 2003).
(3) Incentives: financial incentives have not proved effective in promoting longterm smoking cessation (Cahill & Perera, 2011); the current form of financial
incentives through Quality Outcome Framework payments to record smoking
status and raise the topic of smoking with patients does not appear to have
increased rates of prescribing stop-smoking medications as an objective
marker of smoking-cessation activity (Coleman, 2010).

(4) Coercion: criminalisation and decriminalisation of use of psychoactive drugs
appear to have little or no effect on prevalence of drug use (Drugs and Public
Policy Group, 2010).
(5) Training: advanced driver training does not appear to promote safer driving or
reduce traffic accident rates (Ker, Roberts, Collier, Renton, & Bunn, 2003).
(6) Restrictions: residency restrictions on sex-offenders do not appear to be
effective in reducing reoffending (Durling, 2006).
(7) Enablement: relatively brief physician counselling does not appear to be
effective in helping obese individuals reduce calorie intake (Tsai & Wadden,
2009).
(8) Modelling: The widely adopted Drug Abuse Resistance Education project
which included use of role modelling was ineffective in preventing later illicit
drug use in adolescents (Vincus, Ringwalt, Harris, & Shamblen, 2010).
(9) Environmental restructuring: prompts and reminders have been found to be
ineffective in increasing the rate of physician prescribing of antihypertensive
medication (Heidenreich, 2003).

Recent developments in research on behaviour change have identified highly costeffective interventions tackling unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking
and salt reduction (Asaria, Chisholm, Mathers, Ezzati, & Beaglehole, 2007; Cecchini
et al., 2010; WHO, 2003). In collaboration with WHO and other partners, The
Lancet convened some of the world’s leading scientists working in chronic diseases
and commissioned a series of reviews to examine the evidence for behavioural
interventions aimed at disease prevention. This is summarised below, with BCW
policies and intervention functions signalled in brackets.
A modelling analysis of behavioural interventions combining the health and
economic outcomes of interventions targeting unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and
obesity showed the following to be cost-effective (Cecchini et al., 2010):
(1) Fiscal measures [policy] that increase the price of unhealthy food content
[coercion] or reduce the cost of healthy foods rich in fibre [incentivisation]
were found to produce the largest health gains in the shortest timeframe, being
consistently cost-saving and generating the largest health effects in both 20
years and 50 years.
(2) Regulation [policy] of food advertising to children that improves nutritional
information [education] or restricts the marketing of unhealthy foods to
children [environmental restructuring] were found to have very favourable cost
effectiveness ratios, as do mass media [policy] and worksite health promotion
[persuasion, education] campaigns.
(3) Service delivery [policy]: Physician counselling of individuals at risk in primary
care [enablement] is one of the most effective interventions, but its health effect
is greatest and cost-effectiveness best in countries where a larger proportion of
the population has regular access to primary-care physicians and facilities.
(4) Communication/marketing [policy]: School-based health promotion interventions [persuasion, education] consistently have unfavourable cost-effectiveness
ratios up to 50 years from their initial implementation. However, the costeffectiveness of interventions targeting young children tends to improve

substantially in a longer timeframe (greater than 50 years), as these
interventions realise their full potential in improving health.
This review also found that, consistent with NICE’s review of behaviour change
interventions, multiple-intervention strategies achieved substantially larger health
gains than individual interventions, and often more cost effectively.
A review of interventions to reduce tobacco and salt intake over 10 years
(20062015) found they could avert 13.8 million deaths at a cost of less than US$0.40
per person per year in low-income and lower middle-income countries, and
US$0.501.00 per person per year in upper middle-income countries (as of 2005)
(Asaria et al., 2007). The tobacco control interventions were:
(1) Fiscal measures [policy]: increased taxes on tobacco products [coercion] to
reduce smoking prevalence.
(2) Legislation [policy] to enforce smoke-free workplaces [environmental restructuring].
(3) Legislation [policy] requirements for FCTC-compliant packaging and labelling of tobacco products [environmental restructuring] combined with public
awareness campaigns [policy] about the health risks of smoking [education/
persuasion], and
(4) A comprehensive ban [policy] on tobacco advertising, promotion and
sponsorship [environmental restructuring].
Conclusions
Governments have a duty of care to protect citizens from external and internal
threats. They seek approval from electorates in part on the basis of promises to enact
policies that will benefit health and wellbeing and that the public will accept. If they
limit the options they are willing to consider on the basis of doctrines such as ‘nudge’
they will fail in that responsibility and will directly contribute to unnecessary death
and suffering. Part of the reason why this doctrine has gained currency is a lack of a
clear comprehensive framework for analysing behaviour and determining an
intervention strategy. Such frameworks as have been used, such as MINDSPACE,
are partial and lack coherence. This article presents a system for analysing behaviour
in context (the COM-B system), a theory of motivation that encompasses both
reflective and automatic processes and how they interact (PRIME), and a framework
for classifying interventions and policies (the BCW) which can be linked to the
analysis of behaviour. This systematic, comprehensive and theory-based approach to
intervention development should help policy makers to select intervention strategies
that have a reasonable chance of being effective. Only within this context should the
issues of public acceptability and practicability be considered; they are key to the
success of interventions but should not be the starting point.

(Received 24 August 2011; final version received 10 December 2011)
This review presents a case study of Government policy in relation to behaviour
change and suggests ways of strengthening it by drawing on theoretical and
empirical approaches from health psychology. It aims to inform policy-makers
and politicians about the value of behavioural science, and to provide
psychologists with an example of engagement with Government. It is based on
two Health Psychology submissions to the 2010 UK House of Lords’ Science and
Technology Select Committee inquiry into Behaviour Change. The Inquiry
examined current knowledge about what interventions can effectively influence
behaviour, how behaviour change interventions can be used to achieve policy
goals and what factors should be taken into account by government in
determining whether a particular behaviour change intervention is appropriate.
The review critiques current UK Government thinking about behaviour change
and presents a number of linked frameworks for determining which behaviour
change interventions and policies it would be sensible to research and implement.
These include the COM-B system, a systems approach to understanding
behaviour in context; the PRIME Theory of motivation; the Behaviour Change
Wheel, including a comprehensive listing of intervention functions and policy
levers; and behaviour change techniques. We end with considerations of
intervention development, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

interventions; evidence-based policy; ‘Nudge’; theory; government policy

Introduction
In 2010, the UK House of Lords’ Science and Technology Select Committee
launched a wide-ranging inquiry into Behaviour Change and called for evidence from
the national and international scientific and policy communities and beyond (www.
parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/science-technology/behaviourchange/Cf
EBehaviourChange.pdf). To our knowledge, this is the first such exercise by any
national legislative body. The evidence was received by a panel of 12 peers with
expertise in science, ethics and policy; the expert advisor to the panel was a health
psychologist. Whilst the submissions could be on any aspect of behaviour change, the
great majority of the 150 or so submissions concerned health.
The context for the inquiry was as follows:
To meet many of the societal challenges we are currently facing  such as achieving an
80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 or reducing the burden on the health

service as a result of smoking, drinking or the rise in obesity  individual and collective
behaviour will need to change significantly . . .. The inquiry will examine our current
state of knowledge about what interventions can effectively influence behaviour, how
behaviour change interventions which have been designed on the basis of that
knowledge can be used to achieve policy goals, and what factors should be taken into
account by government in determining whether a particular behaviour change
intervention is appropriate.

The select committee set out to investigate, amongst other things, the policy
implications of recent developments in research on behaviour change, whether
current UK government behaviour change interventions are evidence-based and
subject to appropriate evaluation, the relationship between government, industry and
the voluntary sector in promoting behaviour change and the social and ethical issues
surrounding the use of behaviour change interventions by government. This article is
based on two health psychology submissions (Michie & West, 2010; West & Michie,
2010) one of which was invited as part of expert witness evidence to the Inquiry. It
addresses five of the 16 questions posed by the Inquiry: What is known about how
behaviour can be influenced? What should be classified as a behaviour change
intervention? How should different levels of intervention (individual, organisational,
community and national) and different types of intervention (legislative, fiscal,
educative) interact in order to achieve policy goals more effectively? Should
behaviour change interventions be used in isolation or in combination with other
policy interventions? What are the policy implications of recent developments in
research on behaviour change?
We begin this review with a critique of current UK Government thinking about
behaviour change and then propose an agenda for designing theory-based behaviour
change interventions of interest to policy-makers and for systematically developing
the science base and technology of behaviour change. This includes brief summaries of:
(1) The COM-B system: a systems approach to understanding behaviour in
context.
(2) The PRIME Theory of motivation which draws together into a single coherent
model the broad range of motivational processes, from drives and impulses to
analysis and self-conscious decision making.
(3) The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) which includes a comprehensive listing
of categories of intervention functions and the policy levers that may be used
to enact these.
(4) Taxonomies of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) which form the components of behaviour change interventions.
(5) We end with considerations of intervention development, effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness.

The UK Government’s approach to behaviour change
The UK coalition Government has declared its intention of avoiding coercive
interventions or those that impose ‘bureaucratic restrictions’ on individuals or
industry, and has established a ‘Behavioural Insight Team’ to help them achieve this.
Its work is illustrated in the following response to a House of Lords parliamentary
question (emphases ours):

Health Psychology Review

3

Asked by Lord Bassam of Brighton
To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many staff are employed in the Behavioural
Insight Team in the Cabinet Office; what are their terms of reference; to whom they
report; to whom they are accountable; and when they are expected to complete their
work programme. [HL3958]
Lord Taylor of Holbeach: ‘The Behavioural Insights Team has seven full-time staff.
Their terms of reference are to develop more cost-effective and less bureaucratic ways of
changing behaviour in ways that give citizens and communities greater control of their
own lives. They will achieve this in three ways. First, by proactively developing ideas for
achieving behavioural change using less bureaucratic methods across a wide range of
government policy and activity. In this mode the team will actively seek out areas where
behavioural science applications could be usefully applied. Secondly, by pursuing nonbureaucratic and non-coercive alternatives to regulation. And thirdly, by creating and
facilitating alliances and partnerships between government, business, media and the
third sector to deliver and activate the ideas developed above.’

The emphasis on the virtue of ‘non-bureaucratic’ (rather than, say, ‘effective’)
interventions reflects the Government’s underlying philosophy that eschews explicit
regulation and promotes behaviour change by more subtle means such as priming
and framing, social norm feedback, default options, incentivisation and environmental cues. The Behavioural Insight Team draws heavily on a book called ‘Nudge’:
Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness’ (Thaler & Sunstein,
2008). Common parlance includes ‘nudge thinking’, ‘nudge interventions’, ‘nudge
policies’ and even ‘nudge theory’. ‘Nudge’ is defined as ‘any aspect of the ‘choice
architecture’ that alters people’s behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding
any options or significantly changing their economic incentives’. This is put forward
as the ‘third way’ between libertarianism and paternalism. Libertarian paternalists
‘want to make it easy for people to go their own way; they do not want to burden
those who want to exercise their freedom’ (p. 5). .. . . ‘Libertarian paternalism is a
relatively weak, soft, and nonintrusive type of paternalism because choices are not
blocked, fenced off, or significantly burdened. If people want to smoke cigarettes, to
eat a lot of candy, to choose an unsuitable health care plan, or to fail to save for
retirement, libertarian paternalists will not force them to do otherwise  or even
make things hard for them’ (p. 6).
Eschewing other potentially more powerful interventions does not take into
account the conflicting interests in society: one person’s ‘freedom’ is another person’s
burden e.g. the ‘freedom’ to smoke extends the years of illness and disability for which
the smoker requires others to care for them; the ‘freedom’ to make potentially harmful
food attractive maximises profit for the food industry. Many large corporations have
no qualms about using more directive, coercive and powerful methods of shaping our
behaviours. The most striking example is cigarettes which besides containing an
addictive drug, nicotine, are engineered to maximise the impact of this drug in terms of
speed of delivery and potent conditioned stimuli (Rabinoff, Caskey, Rissling, & Park,
2007). Gaming machines use sophisticated operant conditioning techniques to
maximise behaviour rate. The food industry engineers its products, for example with
large amounts of hidden salt, to maximise immediate taste appeal (Magriplis et al.,
2011). The alcohol industry uses sophisticated marketing techniques tapping into core
aspects of identity to attract people to its products (Anderson, 2009).

The ‘nudge’ doctrine also discounts the duty of the state, in a democracy, to
protect its citizens from the harmful effects of such manipulation; protection may
require regulation, service provision, legislation and fiscal measures which research
findings have shown the public happy to accept (Bassi, 2010; Maryon-Davis & Jolley,
2010; YouGov, 2010).
Advocates of ‘nudge’ argue for a collaboration between government and the
market ‘to steer people’s choices in directions that will improve their lives’. Of note is
reference to the notion of choice rather than to behaviour. This is based on the
erroneous assumption that the behaviours that harm people’s health are exclusively
the result of choice, and that impulses driven by instinct and past associations that
do not involve reflective analysis do not play a significant role in shaping behaviour.
Thus, while the book makes much of cognitive biases, these are all considered to
work through a process of reflective option selection and not as part of the flow of
behaviour that is undertaken without self-awareness. Due weight is not given to the
powerful associative learning influences that interact with drives and emotions. An
example of the lack of attention to the role of context and impulse-driven motivation
in shaping behaviour is ‘in many cases, people make pretty bad decisions  decisions
they would not have made if they had paid full attention and possessed complete
information, unlimited cognitive abilities, and complete self-control’ (p. 6). Even if
people had all these resources and had made a decision to behave in a healthy
fashion, influences such as associative learning, widely used by the advertising
industry, will serve to push people off their chosen path.
A consideration of the effectiveness of ‘nudge interventions’ within the existing
UK public health environment that is shaped largely by industry suggests that the
evidence, where it exists, shows little or no effect (Marteau, Ogilvie, Roland, Suhrcke,
& Kelly, 2011).
The ‘nudge’ approach pre-judges the key issues that should be considered in
designing intervention strategy. Interventions need to be affordable, practicable and
publicly acceptable but if they are not effective these count for nothing. There is no
substitute for a rigorous evaluation of the evidence and a systematic analysis of the
behaviour in context in the light of that evidence. If a government turns its back on
interventions that evidence clearly shows are likely to be effective and which are
affordable, practicable and carry public support, and instead they back interventions
that derive from inconclusive evidence that is tangentially related to the behaviour at
issue but fits with a particular doctrine, human lives may be lost in their thousands.
Also missing is a consideration of the context of the harm posed by behaviour;
the central role that the notion of harm should play in intervention selection is
articulated by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in its Ladder of Interventions and
stewardship model (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2007). The ‘nudge’ approach
forswears ‘banning’ activities and yet no rational thinker could imagine that, were
cigarettes to be invented today, they should be permitted for sale. The fact that the
harms they cause were only discovered recently has led to an anomalous situation in
which governments concerned about public health have been forced to use other
interventions such as education and persuasion to limit that harm, and every attempt
to go further has been vigorously opposed by a hugely influential and wealthy
industry that uses the fact that its products are legal as a key defence.
The ‘nudge’ doctrine is not adequate to deal with the behaviour change challenges
facing society. It does not engage in a systematic analysis to determine likely

intervention effectiveness, and allows political values to influence judgements about
other criteria such as effectiveness and public acceptability. The political values
underpinning adoption of the ‘nudge’ doctrine are revealed by the fact it is favoured
in cases where major industries, such as the alcohol and food industries, fear they
may lose business, but not in cases where there are no major industry stakeholders.
For example, the new stimulant drug ‘mephedrone’ was quickly banned even though
the harms to users and society appear to be substantially less than from tobacco or
alcohol. Coercive policies are also favoured with regard to getting people off sickness
and unemployment benefit and forcing drug-users by court order into treatment
programmes.
The arena of behaviour change where the Government favours ‘nudge’ is one that
does not involve a level playing field. Since industry can and does use interventions
that go well beyond ‘nudge’ to influence the behaviour of consumers, a socially
responsible behaviour change strategy needs to take account of the fact that all our
behaviours are subject to powerful manipulation by companies through marketing
and product design. The tobacco, gambling, ‘fast food’ and alcohol industries spend
many millions of pounds and dollars exploiting our psychology to sell their products.
If governments eschew interventions that protect us against this, ‘choices’ are not
free  they are dictated by commercial exploitation. An example of how industry uses
the vast resources at its disposal to influence consumer behaviour is Coca Cola’s
spend on advertising, estimated at $2.44 billion in 2009 (http://www.adbrands.net/us/
cocacola_us.htm).
It may be noted that, like Odysseus who instructed the crew of his ship to tie him
to the mast and to block their own ears with wax so that they would not be lured by
the song of the sirens to steer the ship on to the rocks, the public will often support
coercive or restrictive interventions that prevent them succumbing to temptation. For
example, a large-scale survey of adults in Britain found that 77% supported getting
rid of cigarette vending machines completely, 73% wanted tobacco put out of sight in
shops and 67% supported banning TV advertising of junk food before 9 pm
(YouGov, 2010). There is also widespread approval even among smokers of the use of
tax increases as a way of curtailing smoking behaviour (Gardner & West, 2011) and
almost half the adult population of England would even support a total ban on sale
of cigarettes (Shahab & West, 2011).
‘Nudge’ is an ideologically driven doctrine, the application of which will result in
poor policy decisions with respect to health behaviour change. It should be replaced
with a systematic evidence-based approach to selecting interventions and determining policy. It is recognised that values should shape and constrain behavioural
interventions. The criticism of the ‘nudge’ doctrine is that it does so from a narrow
political perspective rather than a broader societal one. Thus it rules out
interventions that most members of society would be happy to accept if they were
explained. Rather than starting from a restricted range of intervention options,
Government should give systematic and comprehensive consideration to the range of
interventions that may be applicable to determine its behaviour change strategies. We
present such an approach aimed to be usable by psychologists and policy-makers
alike. The starting point is an analysis of the behaviour to be changed which
conceptualises behaviour as a system incorporating context (the COM-B system).
For example, understanding physical activity must take into account weather, local
geography and availability of facilities, and GP advice to stop smoking is very

6

S. Michie and R. West

different in contexts where GPs can provide free medication or refer to a behavioural
support programme than when these options are not available.
This analysis is linked to an evidence-based method for selecting amongst a
comprehensive, systematically organised and theoretically grounded range of
intervention options (the BCW). The selected interventions can, in turn, be linked
to specific BCTs and general policies to support their delivery in a way that is
sensitive to specific contexts.

A model of behaviour in context: the COM-B System
Applying the principle of parsimony, we sought to identify the simplest overarching
model needed to account for change in a behaviour. By behaviour, we mean ‘anything
a person does in response to internal or external events. Actions may be overt (motor
or verbal) and directly measurable, or covert (activities not viewable e.g. physiological responses) and indirectly measurable; behaviours are physical events that occur
in the body and are controlled by the brain’ (Hobbs, Campbell, Hildon, & Michie,
2011). We drew on two sources representing very different traditions: a US consensus
meeting of behavioural theorists in 1991 (Fishbein et al., 2001), and a principle of US
criminal law dating back many centuries. The former identified three factors that
were necessary and sufficient conditions for the performance of a specified volitional
behaviour: the skills necessary to perform the behaviour, a strong intention to
perform the behaviour and no environmental constraints that make it impossible to
perform the behaviour. In US criminal law, it is recognised that for a defendant to be
found guilty of a criminal act three conditions must be present: means/capability,
motive and opportunity (Means, motive, and opportunity, 2011). Logic dictates that
this can be extended to any action. This provides the starting point for a
comprehensive framework for understanding behaviour: as a system of interacting
elements as shown in Figure 1. The arrows represent potential for causal inference.
Thus, capability, motivation and opportunity are all necessary conditions for a given
behaviour, the behaviour can influence all three of these and capability and
opportunity can both influence motivation.
We can divide each of the sources of behaviour into two types. Capability can be
either physical (in the case of physical skills, physical strength, etc.) or psychological (in
the case of psychological resources and skills, knowledge, capacity for understanding

Figure 1. The COM-B system: a framework for understanding behaviour.

etc.). For motivation, reflective (involving self-conscious planning, analysis and
decision-making) and automatic processes (involving emotional reactions, drives and
habits) play a role. In the case of opportunity, it is possible to distinguish between what
is afforded by the physical environment (resources, locations, physical barriers, etc.)
and the social environment (concepts available in language, exposure to ideas, etc.).
This model provides a basis for specifying what drives and enables behaviour
patterns and individual behaviours. It is thus a model of behaviour per se, and
provides the basis for a model of behaviour change. It puts the nature of the
behaviour to be changed at its core: a COM-B analysis of the behaviour has direct
implications for the types of intervention likely to be effective. A systematic, theorybased approach to intervention design would be to identify the nature of the desired
change and then systematically consider each of the components that would be
necessary, practicable and acceptable to achieve that change.
In the case of health-related behaviour, it is apparent that motivation in its
broadest sense lies at its heart. Thus smokers are physically capable of not lighting
up, excessive drinkers are physically able to abstain and so on. Motivation is not
simply a matter of reflective choice; a COM-B analysis requires an understanding of
how reflective and automatic motivation interact to determine behaviour. There are a
number of models that have begun to explore this (e.g. Strack & Deutsch, 2004) but
one in particular explicitly seeks to bring together the full range of motivational
constructs into a single coherent model.
PRIME Theory of motivation
Motivation is central to the generation of behaviour. Given all the things that we are
capable of doing and that we have the opportunity to do, motivation determines
what we actually do and how we do it. Motivation goes beyond reason and choice to
all the psychological and physiological processes that energise and direct our
behaviour, including biological drives, emotions and habits (Mook, 1995). There has
been a tendency in recent years to focus on reflective aspects of motivation at the
expense of automatic aspects that have long been known to be important (Mook,
1995). Those that have focused on automatic processes have often not recognised
important distinctions within these processes (Keren & Schul, 2009). For example,
within operant conditioning there is evidence of an important distinction between
the learning of stimulus-impulse associations (habit) and associations between
stimuli and anticipation of pleasure or avoidance of discomfort (goal-directed
behaviour)(Skinner, 1953).
A comprehensive theory that represents the structure of human motivation as a
number of levels is PRIME Theory (West, 2006) (see Figure 2), with PRIME
standing for Plans, Responses, Impulses/inhibition, Motives and Evaluations.
According to this theory, ‘higher’ levels of motivation have evolved later than lower
levels and provide greater flexibility of response, but crucially are only able to
influence behaviour by acting as stimuli to lower levels. Higher levels of motivation
permit both greater flexibility of responding and anticipation of future events. Thus
reflex responses are the lowest level and simply involve organisation of a response in
response to a stimulus. Impulses and counter-impulses allow for immediate stimuli
with the strongest motivational force to control behaviour. Motives/desires allow for
goal-directed behaviour to the extent that possible futures can be imagined.

8

S. Michie and R. West

Figure 2. The structure of human motivation in PRIME Theory.
Note: Plans are self-conscious intentions to perform an action in the future. Beliefs are
propositions that are held to be true. Wants and needs are imagined futures to which are
attached anticipated pleasure/satisfaction and relief from mental or physical discomfort
respectively. Impulses are organised action schemas, and counter impulses are inhibitory
countervailing processes. Responses involve initiating, modifying or stopping an action. The
internal environment involves an ever-changing flux of emotional states, drive states, images
and cognitive schemata. The external environment involves stimuli impacting on the sense
organs. Reflective processes involve self-conscious information processing. Automatic
processes do not require conscious awareness although their results may be the object of
reflection and form part of ongoing experience.

Evaluations allow for goal-directed behaviour where goals can be communicated
through language and derived from inference and analysis. Plans allow for
behaviours to be deferred according to priorities or anticipated opportunity or
threat.
Thus what we believe to be good or bad can only influence our actions if our
beliefs make us want or need things at the relevant moment. Similarly, what we
intend to do at one time can only direct what we actually do if the intention is
remembered and generates sufficiently strong wants or needs in the moment to
overcome competing wants and needs from the immediate environment. In summary,
wants and needs compete at each moment for control over our actions and these are
under strong stimulus control as a result of past associative learning, and current
drives and emotional states.
Previous models of health-related behaviour have considered only a limited
number of ways in which change occurs. A great deal of attention is focused on
communication and inferential reasoning but associative learning is also crucial, as
are many other processes (see Table 1).
PRIME Theory notes that the motivational system is fundamentally ‘chaotic’
which means that small triggers can have large effects, and change can be sudden or
gradual or involve a long period of apparently random switching between states.
Approaches such as the ‘stages of change’ model that propose an orderly transition
in behaviour change, only account for a small proportion of instances of behaviour

change and can lead to inappropriate interventions (West, 2005). In the field of
smoking, for example, many smokers who appear not to be ready to stop will
respond favourably to an offer of help and will go on to become ex-smokers, contrary
to what would be expected from the ‘stages of change’ model (Pisinger, Vestbo,
Borch-Johnsen, & Jorgensen, 2005).
PRIME Theory further notes that, as a result of self-awareness, we as humans
develop mental representations of ourselves about which we have strong feelings.
These ‘identities’ are a very important source of wants and needs which give stability
to behaviour patterns; in many cases, a change in identity is a fundamental driver of
behaviour change. This has been cited as important in recovery from drug addiction
(White, 2004), and is cited as a major factor underlying spontaneous recovery and
forms part of the treatment approach offered by organisations such as Alcoholics
Anonymous which is widely used in many countries (Kaskutas, 2009). Self-control
involves a domination of reflective over automatic processes and this requires
psychological skills, mental energy (a finite resource) and efficient downward
connections between parts of the brain involved in reflective processes and the
automatic channels through which they must operate.
Thus, fundamental tenets of PRIME Theory are, first, that at every moment we
act in pursuit of what we most ‘want’ (anticipating pleasure or satisfaction) or ‘need’
(anticipating relief from mental or physical discomfort) at that moment. Second,
these are feelings and we do not have to verbalise them (even internally) for them to
influence our actions. Also, third, beliefs about what is good or bad and preformed
plans (reflective processes) can only influence our actions if they generate sufficiently
strong wants or needs at the relevant moment to overcome competing wants or needs
arising from more direct sources such as past associations and drive states. Our
identities are a very important source of wants and needs and can often be key to
achieving lasting behaviour change. Self-control is fundamental to much behaviour
change and to facilitate this it is necessary to develop psychological capabilities as
well as motivation to change, and to provide an environment conducive to this. Stress
and other psychological demands deplete reserves of mental energy and make it

10

S. Michie and R. West

harder for individuals to exercise self-control. The concept of mental energy has been
operationalised and studied, but as yet does not have a clear physiological substrate
and so can best be considered as a ‘metaphor’.
PRIME Theory provides a broad conceptualisation of motivation and its
influences that can help to develop interventions designed to change health-related
behaviours. Concepts developed in COM-B and PRIME Theory have been linked
with a comprehensive classification of intervention functions and policy categories to
form a theoretically based system for developing behaviour change interventions.
This is discussed in the following section.
A system for classifying interventions: the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW)
A behaviour change intervention is a co-ordinated set of activities designed to change
specified behaviour patterns. Usually these behaviour patterns are measured in terms
of the prevalence or incidence of particular behaviours in specified populations (e.g.
prevalence of tobacco smoking or incidence of delivery of brief advice from a
physician to stop smoking).
When designing or evaluating behaviour change interventions, one needs to begin
with a comprehensive analysis of what is driving the current behaviour pattern and
the available intervention and policy options. This requires an overarching model of
behaviour, and within that of human motivation, and a way of linking this to make a
selection from among the full panoply of intervention and policy options. This
approach contrasts with one which takes an idea, such as ‘nudge’ (Thaler & Sunstein,
2008) and attempts to apply it as a doctrine, thus neglecting all those intervention
strategies that come from a different perspective. It also contrasts with frameworks in
common use by the UK Government, such as MINDSPACE (Institute for
Government, 2010), that are not comprehensive in that they do not cover all
possible intervention types. Neither are they coherent in the sense of using categories
that are mutually exclusive and at similar conceptual levels.
We describe a classification system developed on the basis of a systematic review
of previous frameworks, with a clear goal of being (1) comprehensive, (2) coherent
and (3) based on an overarching model of behaviour (Michie, van Stralen, & West,
2011). It is a starting point for systematically developing the science base in this area
and a behaviour change technology.
The BCW takes the concepts developed in PRIME Theory and COM-B and
applies them to directing the choice of intervention functions and from there to
policy categories needed to enact those interventions. The distinction between
intervention functions and policy categories is illustrated by examples. A COM-B
analysis may determine that there is a requirement to educate particular sectors of
the population about the substantially increased risk of Type-II diabetes with even
moderate overweight. Thus, the intervention function is ‘education’. It then has to
determine what policies would be appropriate to deliver this. It may be ‘Communications/marketing’ (for example with a TV campaign), or ‘Service delivery’ (for
example, by primary healthcare staff giving brief advice to all patients who are
overweight). In a second example, consider that it is decided that an important
intervention function to reduce excessive alcohol consumption would be ‘environmental restructuring’ in which there was reduced exposure to certain kinds of
manipulative promotion by alcohol producers. Depending on the circumstances, it

Health Psychology Review

11

may be decided that this could be achieved through voluntary ‘regulation’ or it may
require ‘legislation’. A striking example of the difference between governmental
policies that have been largely evidence-based and derived from a comprehensive
analysis of the options and those that have been dominated by political ideology or
pandering to commercial interests is tobacco versus alcohol.
The BCW is marked out from other intervention classifications by its explicit
linkage to a comprehensive understanding of behaviour and motivation. It is also
marked out by the fact that the identification of intervention functions and policy
categories was arrived at by a systematic literature search for pre-existing classification
systems. This identified 19 frameworks of behaviour change (Michie, van Stralen, &
West, 2011). Such a comprehensive list is crucial because, unless intervention
designers and policy-makers can see the full set of options available for achieving
behaviour change, they are likely to overlook some that could be particularly
effective. An analysis of these frameworks revealed nine broad functions of
interventions and seven categories of supporting policies.
Merely listing the intervention and policy options can be useful as a reminder of
ones that would otherwise be missed. However, the BCW goes beyond that. It forms
the basis for a scientific analysis of how to make the selection. This is based on a
COM-B analysis of the target behaviour, along with key principles of likely
effectiveness, affordability, ethical acceptability, public acceptability and capacity
to be implemented within the current context.
The BCW classification system shows where doctrines such as ‘nudge’ fit within
the broad framework of behaviour change and the a-priori limits they impose on
intervention options. It also provides an analysis of the behaviour itself in relation to
the potential interventions and policies for change. The BCW is illustrated
diagrammatically in Figure 3 and definitions with examples are listed in Table 2.
An intervention strategy is a selection of intervention functions and policies to
enact or support these. Choice of intervention strategy only takes one so far in
attempting to change behaviour. Even the appropriate mix of intervention functions
is no guarantee of success. It is necessary to go to a more fine grained analysis of the
specific BCTs that make up the interventions.
Delivering interventions: behaviour change techniques (BCTs)
Each intervention function involves one or more specific BCTs. BCTs are irreducible
activities designed to achieve behaviour change (Michie, Abraham et al., 2011;
Michie, Johnston, Francis, Hardeman, & Eccles, 2008). Taxonomies of such
techniques that can be reliably used for specifying interventions have been developed
in relation to key behaviours related to health: smoking (Michie, Churchill, & West,
2011; Michie, Hyder, Walia, & West, 2011; West, Walia, Hyder, Shahab, & Michie,
2010), excessive alcohol use (Michie et al., in press), physical inactivity and unhealthy
eating (Abraham & Michie, 2008; Michie, Ashford et al., 2011; Michie et al., 2008).
Interventions may comprise many individual BCTs and the same BCT may be
evident across several interventions.
An example of applying an analysis of interventions based on BCTs comes from
the UK’s NHS Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT: www.ncsct.co.
uk), an academic-health service partnership. Analysing the enabling function of the
Stop-Smoking Services by BCT has identified the specific activities of its service

an analysis of behaviour.

provision that are associated with better success rates in their clients (West et al.,
2010). Out of 43 BCTs identified, a set of core ones were found to differentiate more
successful from less successful services (see Table 3). These cover the range of
processes described in PRIME Theory. For example, advising smokers on changing
their routines helps to avoid impulses to smoke in the presence of smoking cues.
Measuring expired-air carbon monoxide concentrations provides a strong image to
smokers of the harm from smoking and the immediate gains from stopping that
makes smokers feel positive about abstinence. Advising on stop smoking medications
allows smokers to make best use of those medications and so reduce the acquired
drive to smoke when nicotine concentrations in the brain are depleted and they
experience learned impulses to smoke. Helping smokers achieve an ex-smoker
identity enables them to put firm barriers around their behaviour so that smoking is
‘not an option’ at any time, just as it would be if they were in a supermarket. There is
much more work to be done on BCTs and their links with interventions and the
nature of the target behaviour, but a start has been made.
The BCW is currently being developed into a theory- and evidence-based tool
allowing a range of users to design and select interventions and policies according to
an analysis of the nature of the behaviour, the mechanisms that need to be changed in
order to bring about behaviour change, the interventions and policies required to
change those mechanisms and the BCTs required to deliver them.

Developing an effective intervention strategy
An effective ‘intervention strategy’ will involve a combination of intervention
functions, enacted using policies identified using criteria such as effectiveness, cost,

practicability and acceptability. Of these criteria, effectiveness is clearly a necessary
condition.
A crucial lesson from the accumulated evidence in many different areas is that
what is effective for a given behaviour, delivered in a particular way, in a given target
group and a given context may not be effective for other behaviours, target groups,
etc. The only way to be sure that a proposed intervention strategy in a given context
will be effective is to try it and evaluate it. The choice of strategy to implement
and evaluate should be based on the best available relevant evidence coupled with a
sound understanding of the underlying principles. A theoretical understanding of
behaviour and behaviour change, and previous research evaluating specific
interventions are crucial in designing intervention strategies that stand a better
chance of success, or in ruling out strategies that are unlikely to be effective (Craig
et al., 2008).
Using theory to design an intervention strategy is helpful and recommended
(Craig et al., 2008; Michie et al., 2008). This requires:
(1) an understanding of the nature of the behaviour to be changed and the
context. We have proposed a model that analyses the behaviour in terms of
‘capability’, ‘motivation’ and ‘opportunity’; these are necessary conditions for
the new behaviour pattern to emerge and point to where the deficiency
currently lies. This allows one to determine what needs to change in order for
the behavioural target to be achieved;
(2) a system for considering the full panoply of possible intervention functions
and identifying which are likely to be effective to bring about the necessary

Health Psychology Review

15

change identified above. Further details of this approach are available in
Michie et al. (2011b).;
(3) a method for designing the intervention strategy. Candidate intervention
functions are selected on the basis of the analysis at (i), and relevant evidence
of effective interventions and component BCTs. Relevant evidence should be
searched systematically rather than ‘cherry picked’.
When it comes to using previous research to design an intervention strategy, the
best starting point is to look for relevant systematic reviews. Two very good sources
for these in domains related to health are the Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com) and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
guidance documents (www.nice.org.uk). NICE has written generic guidance on
behaviour change interventions (Abraham, Kelly, West, & Michie, 2009; National
Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, 2007). Because it was constrained by its
brief not to go into specific examples, the guidance was necessarily general and could
be seen as promoting ‘motherhood and apple pie’. However, careful inspection of the
guidance will reveal important guiding principles that are rarely adopted in practice;
if they were, a great deal of public money would be saved on repeated promulgation
of ineffective intervention strategies.
There were 11 key psychological targets (which address both ‘reflective’ and
‘automatic’ aspects of human motivation) identified:
(1) Knowledge and outcome expectancies (helping people to develop accurate
knowledge about the health consequences of their behaviours).
(2) Personal relevance (emphasising the personal salience of health behaviours,
that is, what the consequences mean for individuals).
(3) Positive affective attitudes (promoting positive feelings towards the outcomes
of behaviour change).
(4) Descriptive norms (promoting the visibility of positive health behaviours in
people’s reference groups  that is, the groups they compare themselves with,
or aspire to).
(5) Subjective norms (enhancing social approval for positive health behaviours in
significant others and reference groups).
(6) Personal and moral norms (promoting personal and moral commitments to
behaviour change).
(7) Self-efficacy (enhancing people’s belief in their ability to change).
(8) Intention/goal setting and the formation of concrete plans (helping people to
form plans and goals in graded steps, over time and in specific contexts,
including making if-then plans and developing appropriate coping strategies).
(9) Behavioural contracts (inviting people to commit to their plans with others)
(10) Social relationships (helping people recognise how their social contexts and
relationships may affect their behaviour).
(11) Relapse prevention (helping people to develop skills to cope with difficult
situations and conflicting goals once they have initiated change).
A general conclusion of this NICE guidance was that the most effective interventions
were those that acted simultaneously at several levels. An example of integrating

16

different levels and types of intervention in relation to a policy goal following the
outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza is shown in Box 1.
Box 1: An example of interacting intervention levels
A systematic review of interventions to increase vaccination amongst health care
workers (Lam, Chambers, MacDougall, & McCarthy, 2010) investigated interventions in 12 randomised controlled trials and controlled before-and-after
studies published from 1992 to 2009. The interventions included education or
promotion (efforts to raise awareness and increase knowledge about influenza and
vaccination); improved access to vaccination (e.g. extended opening hours, mobile
vaccination); legislation or regulation (e.g. mandatory vaccination); measurement
and feedback where rates are tracked and then publicised; and role model work
where senior staff encourage vaccination.
The study found that in hospital settings, education campaigns and interventions to improve access resulted in only small increases in rates of uptake.
Campaigns involving more coercive components achieved higher rates of uptake.
In non-hospital health care settings, they concluded that a combination of
educational campaigns and improved access yielded greatest increases in uptake.
This nicely illustrates the importance of context in intervention effectiveness.
Evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness: importance to policy-makers
The House of Lords Inquiry asked for evidence of effective and ineffective behaviour
change interventions. It was evident from SM’s experience of being called as a
witness to the Inquiry that the members were dissatisfied with the quantity and
quality of the evidence contained within the large number of submissions they
received. They wanted ‘hard evidence’ of effective interventions that could be
recommended to Government. We used the BCW to structure the identification and
presentation of examples, emphasising that they are a small selection derived from a
very extensive evidence base. They address broad questions concerning the types of
intervention that can be effective; it must be stressed that the same type of
intervention can be delivered in many different ways and this would influence its
effectiveness. Implementation of evidence-based interventions across behaviour,
population and setting is not a mechanistic process and is underpinned by a recent
but rapidly developing science (see the journal Implementation Science).
There is an extensive evidence base on specific BCTs to apply within each of the
intervention functions specified in the BCW, and we provide a selection by way of
illustration:
(1) Education: provision of educational materials can increase uptake of cervical
cancer screening (Forbes, Jepson, & Martin-Hirsch, 2002).
(2) Persuasion: hard-hitting mass media campaigns can increase smoking
cessation rates (Bala, Strzeszynski, & Cahill, 2008); brief GP advice increases
smoking cessation rates (Stead, Bergson, & Lancaster, 2008); mass media
campaigns can have an immediate effect in increasing rate of HIV testing
(Vidanapathirana, Abramson, Forbes, & Fairley, 2005).

(3) Incentives: vouchers for pregnant smokers to stop can increase smoking
cessation rates for the duration of the pregnancy (Heil et al., 2008; Higgins
et al., 2010).
(4) Coercion: increasing the price of alcohol and tobacco reduces consumption
(Babor et al., 2003); speed cameras and speeding fines reduce speeding and
vehicle crash rates (Wilson, Willis, Hendrikz, Le Brocque, & Bellamy, 2010);
random breath testing and driving bans reduce drink-driving and alcoholrelated death rates (Babor et al., 2003).
(5) Training: social skills training can reduce antisocial behaviour (Losel &
Beelmann, 2010); parenting training can reduce unintentional injury rates in
children (Kendrick, Barlow, Hampshire, Polnay, & Stewart-Brown, 2007).
(6) Restrictions: restricting availability, for example by reducing outlet density, has
been found to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol related harm
(Babor et al., 2003).
(7) Enablement: behavioural support and medications such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion and varenicline are effective in helping smokers to
stop (Cahill, Stead, & Lancaster, 2007; Hughes, Stead, & Lancaster, 2007;
Lancaster & Stead, 2005; Stead, Perera, Bullen, Mant, & Lancaster, 2008);
methadone maintenance treatment is effective in reducing criminal activity to
fund heroin use (Drugs and Public Policy Group, 2010); gastric banding
surgery reduces calorie intake and therefore obesity (Colquitt, Picot, Loveman, & Clegg, 2009).
(8) Modelling: hand-washing by senior role models can increase hand hygiene
behaviour of healthcare workers (Lankford et al., 2003).
(9) Environmental restructuring: prompts and reminders can improve health
professional management of diabetic patients (Renders et al., 2001).
The following examples of ineffective interventions are a small selection from a very
extensive evidence base. It must be remembered, however, that proving a negative is
impossible and when it comes to conclusions about intervention effectiveness with
regard to behaviour change it is more common to encounter statements of the kind
‘the evidence is too weak to support any firm conclusions’. Where the negative
evidence is strong we simply state the finding but where it is weaker we use phrases
such as ‘does not appear to’.
(1) Education: drug and alcohol education in schools has been found to be
ineffective (Babor et al., 2003; Drugs and Public Policy Group, 2010).
(2) Persuasion: school-based programmes including attempts at persuasion have
not been effective in reducing overeating in children (Summerbell et al., 2005);
public service announcements have proved ineffective in reducing excessive
alcohol consumption (Babor et al., 2003).
(3) Incentives: financial incentives have not proved effective in promoting longterm smoking cessation (Cahill & Perera, 2011); the current form of financial
incentives through Quality Outcome Framework payments to record smoking
status and raise the topic of smoking with patients does not appear to have
increased rates of prescribing stop-smoking medications as an objective
marker of smoking-cessation activity (Coleman, 2010).

18

S. Michie and R. West
(4) Coercion: criminalisation and decriminalisation of use of psychoactive drugs
appear to have little or no effect on prevalence of drug use (Drugs and Public
Policy Group, 2010).
(5) Training: advanced driver training does not appear to promote safer driving or
reduce traffic accident rates (Ker, Roberts, Collier, Renton, & Bunn, 2003).
(6) Restrictions: residency restrictions on sex-offenders do not appear to be
effective in reducing reoffending (Durling, 2006).
(7) Enablement: relatively brief physician counselling does not appear to be
effective in helping obese individuals reduce calorie intake (Tsai & Wadden,
2009).
(8) Modelling: The widely adopted Drug Abuse Resistance Education project
which included use of role modelling was ineffective in preventing later illicit
drug use in adolescents (Vincus, Ringwalt, Harris, & Shamblen, 2010).
(9) Environmental restructuring: prompts and reminders have been found to be
ineffective in increasing the rate of physician prescribing of antihypertensive
medication (Heidenreich, 2003).

Recent developments in research on behaviour change have identified highly costeffective interventions tackling unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking
and salt reduction (Asaria, Chisholm, Mathers, Ezzati, & Beaglehole, 2007; Cecchini
et al., 2010; WHO, 2003). In collaboration with WHO and other partners, The
Lancet convened some of the world’s leading scientists working in chronic diseases
and commissioned a series of reviews to examine the evidence for behavioural
interventions aimed at disease prevention. This is summarised below, with BCW
policies and intervention functions signalled in brackets.
A modelling analysis of behavioural interventions combining the health and
economic outcomes of interventions targeting unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and
obesity showed the following to be cost-effective (Cecchini et al., 2010):
(1) Fiscal measures [policy] that increase the price of unhealthy food content
[coercion] or reduce the cost of healthy foods rich in fibre [incentivisation]
were found to produce the largest health gains in the shortest timeframe, being
consistently cost-saving and generating the largest health effects in both 20
years and 50 years.
(2) Regulation [policy] of food advertising to children that improves nutritional
information [education] or restricts the marketing of unhealthy foods to
children [environmental restructuring] were found to have very favourable cost
effectiveness ratios, as do mass media [policy] and worksite health promotion
[persuasion, education] campaigns.
(3) Service delivery [policy]: Physician counselling of individuals at risk in primary
care [enablement] is one of the most effective interventions, but its health effect
is greatest and cost-effectiveness best in countries where a larger proportion of
the population has regular access to primary-care physicians and facilities.
(4) Communication/marketing [policy]: School-based health promotion interventions [persuasion, education] consistently have unfavourable cost-effectiveness
ratios up to 50 years from their initial implementation. However, the costeffectiveness of interventions targeting young children tends to improve

Health Psychology Review

substantially in a longer timeframe (greater than 50 years), as these
interventions realise their full potential in improving health.
This review also found that, consistent with NICE’s review of behaviour change
interventions, multiple-intervention strategies achieved substantially larger health
gains than individual interventions, and often more cost effectively.
A review of interventions to reduce tobacco and salt intake over 10 years
(20062015) found they could avert 13.8 million deaths at a cost of less than US$0.40
per person per year in low-income and lower middle-income countries, and
US$0.501.00 per person per year in upper middle-income countries (as of 2005)
(Asaria et al., 2007). The tobacco control interventions were:
(1) Fiscal measures [policy]: increased taxes on tobacco products [coercion] to
reduce smoking prevalence.
(2) Legislation [policy] to enforce smoke-free workplaces [environmental restructuring].
(3) Legislation [policy] requirements for FCTC-compliant packaging and labelling of tobacco products [environmental restructuring] combined with public
awareness campaigns [policy] about the health risks of smoking [education/
persuasion], and
(4) A comprehensive ban [policy] on tobacco advertising, promotion and
sponsorship [environmental restructuring].
Conclusions
Governments have a duty of care to protect citizens from external and internal
threats. They seek approval from electorates in part on the basis of promises to enact
policies that will benefit health and wellbeing and that the public will accept. If they
limit the options they are willing to consider on the basis of doctrines such as ‘nudge’
they will fail in that responsibility and will directly contribute to unnecessary death
and suffering. Part of the reason why this doctrine has gained currency is a lack of a
clear comprehensive framework for analysing behaviour and determining an
intervention strategy. Such frameworks as have been used, such as MINDSPACE,
are partial and lack coherence. This article presents a system for analysing behaviour
in context (the COM-B system), a theory of motivation that encompasses both
reflective and automatic processes and how they interact (PRIME), and a framework
for classifying interventions and policies (the BCW) which can be linked to the
analysis of behaviour. This systematic, comprehensive and theory-based approach to
intervention development should help policy makers to select intervention strategies
that have a reasonable chance of being effective. Only within this context should the
issues of public acceptability and practicability be considered; they are key to the
success of interventions but should not be the starting point.

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

This guideline is the basis of QS84, QS167 and QS183.

Overview
This guideline covers changing health-damaging behaviours among people aged 16 and
over using interventions such as goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, and social
support. It aims to help tackle a range of behaviours including alcohol misuse, poor eating
patterns, lack of physical activity, unsafe sexual behaviour and smoking.

Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• Commissioners and providers
• Young people and adults, and their families and carers

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.

Recommendation 1 Develop a local behaviour
change policy and strategy
National and local policy makers and commissioners of behaviour change services and
their partners (see who should take action?) should:
• Ensure policies and strategies aim to improve everyone's health and wellbeing.
• Use health equity audit to ensure health inequalities will not increase, and if possible
will decrease as a result of the local behaviour change strategy and related
programmes and interventions.
• Develop a commissioning strategy, linked to relevant policies, for an evidence-based
behaviour change programme of population, community, organisational and individuallevel behaviour change interventions. For example, see NICE's guidelines on alcoholuse disorders: prevention and obesity prevention. Also note that the NICE guideline on
behaviour change: general approaches recommends delivering individual interventions
in tandem with complementary activities at the population, community and
organisational levels.
• Work with the local community to develop the strategy (see the NICE guideline on
community engagement).

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Ensure the strategy, and any related policies, are sustainable and meet local needs,
identified through joint strategic needs assessments (JSNAs) and other local data.
• Identify the behaviours the strategy will address, and the outcomes it aims to achieve.
Bear in mind that some interventions and programmes can address more than 1
behaviour (for example, sexual behaviour and alcohol consumption).
• Ensure the content, scale and intensity of each intervention is proportionate to the
level of social, economic or environmental disadvantage someone faces and the
support they need (proportionate universalism).
• Identify a leader within each local authority area, for example, the director of public
health or an elected member of cabinet, to address specific behaviours (such as
smoking and physical activity).

Recommendation 2 Ensure organisation policies,
strategies, resources and training all support
behaviour change
• Directors in national and local organisations whose employees deliver behaviour
change interventions should ensure policies, strategies and resources are in place to
provide behaviour change support for staff, as well as service users. This support
could take the form of behaviour change services for staff. Or it could involve creating
environments that support health-promoting behaviour (for examples, see the NICE
guidelines on tobacco and physical activity in the workplace).
• National and local organisations whose employees deliver behaviour change
interventions should review job descriptions and person specifications to check that
they include behaviour change knowledge and skills (or competencies), if they are a
specific part of someone's job (see recommendation 9).
• Managers of health, wellbeing and social care services should determine which staff in
contact with the public are best placed to deliver different levels of a behaviour
change intervention (see recommendation 9). They should ensure those staff have the
knowledge and skills (or competencies) needed to assess behaviours and individual
needs (see recommendation 8) and to deliver the intervention.
• Employers should ensure staff are aware of the importance of being supportive,
motivating people and showing them empathy (see recommendation 12).

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Directors and managers should ensure staff receive behaviour change training and
supervision related to their roles and responsibilities (see recommendation 9). They
should also be offered ongoing professional development on behaviour change
theories, methods and skills (see recommendation 12).
• Mentors and supervisors with relevant training and experience (see recommendation
11 and recommendation 12) should support staff who are delivering behaviour change
interventions. This includes helping them to set their own goals, providing constructive
feedback on their practice and encouraging them to be aware of their duty of care. It
also involves making them aware of the likely perceptions and expectations of those
taking part in behaviour change interventions and programmes.

Recommendation 3 Commission interventions from
services willing to share intervention details and
data
Commissioners of behaviour change services and their partners (see who should take
action?) should:
• Only commission behaviour change interventions and programmes that meet the
recommendations in this guidance and in the NICE guideline on behaviour change:
general approaches.
• Ensure behaviour change interventions aim to both initiate and maintain change.
Interventions should include techniques to address relapse and recognise that it is
common.
• Commission interventions that are proven to be effective at changing and maintaining
behaviour change. (See recommendation 4; also see the NICE topic pages on alcohol,
diet, nutrition and obesity, physical activity, sexual health and smoking and tobacco.)
• Specify in service specifications that providers:
－ make a detailed description of the intervention publicly available (see
recommendation 6)
－ collate accurate, standardised and comparable routine data on behaviours that
affect health and wellbeing. (For example, behaviours covered by the Public
Health Outcomes Framework.)

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 8 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Commission interventions from providers who agree to make their evaluation and
monitoring data available to commissioners and local and national organisations. (The
aim is to aid the design, delivery and monitoring of service processes and outcomes.)
For example, data could be collected on:
－ process assessment and quality assurance
－ health outcomes.

Recommendation 4 Commission high quality,
effective behaviour change interventions
National and local policy makers, commissioners of behaviour change services and their
partners (see who should take action?) should:
• Find out whether behaviour change interventions and programmes that are already in
place are effective, cost effective and apply evidence-based principles. (See the NICE
guideline on behaviour change: general approaches).
• Ensure that, when commissioning behaviour change interventions and programmes:
－ Evaluation plans tailored for the intervention and target behaviours are built in
from the outset.
－ Resources (staff, time and funds) are allocated for independent evaluation of the
short-, medium- and long-term outcomes.
－ A quality assurance process is in place to assess whether the intervention was
delivered as planned (intervention fidelity), achieves the target behaviour change
and health and wellbeing outcomes, and reduces health inequalities. (The
frequency of quality assurance checks should be specified.)
－ There are quality assurance checks if an intervention has already been shown to
be effective.
－ All information on intervention processes and outcomes is recorded in a form that
can be made available if needed (for example, on a secure database).

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 9 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Commission and evaluate a pilot if it is not clear whether an intervention shown to be
effective for a specific behaviour, population or setting can be applied to other
behaviours, settings or populations (see recommendation 16).
• Commission an intervention for which there is no evidence of effectiveness only if it is
accompanied by an adequately powered and controlled evaluation that measures
relevant outcomes (see recommendation 16).
• Stop running interventions or programmes if there is good evidence to suggest they
are not effective or are harmful.

Recommendation 5 Plan behaviour change
interventions and programmes taking local needs
into account
Commissioners and providers of behaviour change services, and intervention designers
(see who should take action?) should:
• Work together and with other key stakeholders (for example, people who use services,
communities and researchers) to select priority areas for interventions, based on local
need. They should also identify suitable interventions that are acceptable to the target
audiences.
• Take into account the local social and cultural contexts to ensure equitable access for
everyone who needs help and make best use of existing resources and skills.
• Base behaviour change interventions and programmes on evidence of effectiveness
(see recommendations 6 and recommendation 7).

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 10 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Take into account:
－ the objectives of the intervention or programme
－ evaluation plans (see recommendation 4 and recommendation 16)
－ the target population (including characteristics such as socioeconomic status)
－ whether there is a need to offer tailored interventions for specific subgroups (for
example, see the NICE guideline on type 2 diabetes: prevention in people at high
risk)
－ intervention characteristics: content, assessment of participants, mode of
delivery, intensity and duration of the intervention, who will deliver it, where and
when
－ the training needs of those delivering the intervention or programme
－ the quality of the behavioural support provided by those delivering the
intervention or programme
－ availability of, and access to, services once the intervention has finished
－ follow up and support to maintain the new behaviour
－ plans to monitor and measure intervention fidelity.

Recommendation 6 Develop acceptable, practical
and sustainable behaviour change interventions
and programmes
Commissioners of behaviour change services and intervention designers (see who should
take action?) should:
• Work together and with other key stakeholders (for example, people who use services,
communities and researchers) to develop (co-produce) behaviour change
interventions and programmes that are acceptable, practical and sustainable. This
should also reduce duplication between services.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Develop interventions that:
－ are evidence-based
－ have clear objectives that have been developed and agreed with stakeholders
－ identify the core skills, knowledge and experience (competencies) needed to
deliver the intervention (including for the specific behaviour change techniques
used)
－ provide details of the training needed (including learning outcomes) for
practitioners
－ include a monitoring and evaluation plan developed according to agreed
objectives.
• Before implementing a behaviour-change intervention, describe in detail the principles
it is based on. Put these details in a manual. This should include:
－ clearly stated objectives on what the intervention will deliver
－ the evidence base used (such as from NICE guidance on a specific topic)
－ an explanation of how the intervention works (mechanism of action), for example,
by targeting capability, opportunity and motivation.
• Ensure manuals also include a detailed description of the intervention including:
－ resources, setting or context, activities, processes and outcomes (including a
pictorial description of the relationship between these variables, such as a
conceptual map or logic model)
－ intervention characteristics (see recommendation 5)
－ a clear definition of the behaviour change techniques used so that each
component can be replicated (for example, by using a taxonomy)
－ details of how to tailor the intervention to meet individual needs (see
recommendation 8)
－ plans to address long-term maintenance of behaviour change and relapse
－ implementation details: who will deliver what, to whom, when and how.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Make the manual publicly available, for example, on a website (provide copyright
details and 'training before use' requirements). If there are changes to an intervention
during delivery, or after evaluation, ensure the manual is updated accordingly.

Recommendation 7 Use proven behaviour change
techniques when designing interventions
Providers of behaviour change interventions and programmes and intervention designers
should:
• Design behaviour change interventions to include techniques that have been shown to
be effective at changing behaviour. These techniques are described in principle 4 of
the NICE guideline on behaviour change: general approaches and include:
－ Goals and planning. Work with the client to:
◇ agree goals for behaviour and the resulting outcomes
◇ develop action plans and prioritise actions
◇ develop coping plans to prevent and manage relapses
◇ consider achievement of outcomes and further goals and plans.
－ Feedback and monitoring (for example, regular weight assessment for weight
management interventions):
◇ encourage and support self-monitoring of behaviour and its outcomes and
◇ provide feedback on behaviour and its outcomes.
－ Social support. If appropriate advise on, and arrange for, friends, relatives,
colleagues or 'buddies' to provide practical help, emotional support, praise or
reward.
• Ensure the techniques used match the service user's needs (see recommendation 8).
• Consider using other evidence-based behaviour change techniques that may also be
effective. See the NICE topic pages on alcohol, diet, nutrition and obesity, physical
activity, sexual health and smoking and tobacco for details of specific techniques.

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 13 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Clearly define and provide a rationale for all behaviour change techniques that have
been included.
• Ensure novel techniques – or those for which the evidence base is limited – are
evaluated (see recommendation 16).
• Consider delivering an intervention remotely (or providing remote follow-up) if there is
evidence that this is an effective way of changing behaviour. For example, use the
telephone, text messaging, apps or the internet.

Recommendation 8 Ensure interventions meet
individual needs
Providers of behaviour change programmes and interventions and trained behaviour
change practitioners should:
• Ensure service users are given clear information on the behaviour change
interventions and services available and how to use them. If necessary, they should
help people to access the services.
• Ensure services are acceptable to, and meet, service users' needs. This includes any
needs in relation to a disability or another 'protected characteristic' in relation to
equity.
• Recognise the times when people may be more open to change, such as when
recovering from a behaviour-related condition (for example, following diagnosis of
cardiovascular disease) or when becoming a parent. Also recognise when offering a
behaviour change intervention may not be appropriate due to personal circumstances.
Trained behaviour change practitioners (see recommendation 12 and recommendation 13)
should:

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Before starting an intervention:
－ Assess participants' health in relation to the behaviour and the type of actions
needed. For example, they should ensure the level and type of physical activity
recommended is appropriate, bearing in mind the person's physical health. (As an
example, see the NICE guideline on weight management before, during and after
pregnancy.)
－ Ensure the intensity of the intervention matches the person's need for support to
change their behaviour.
－ Discuss what the likely impact will be if the participant makes changes to their
behaviour (in terms of their health and wellbeing and the health and wellbeing of
those they are in contact with).
• Plan at what point before, during and after a behaviour change intervention a review
will be undertaken to assess progress towards goals and then tailor the intervention
and follow-up support accordingly.
• Tailor interventions to meet participants' needs by assessing and then addressing:
－ People's behaviour: if available, use a validated assessment tool appropriate for
the specific population or setting. For example, alcohol screening tools used in
prisons are different from those used in accident and emergency departments.
－ Participants' physical and psychological capability to make change.
－ The context in which they live and work (that is, their physical, economic and
social environment).
－ How motivated they are to change: if many behaviours need to be changed,
assess which one – or ones – the person is most motivated to tackle (see
capability, opportunity and motivation).
－ Any specific needs with regards to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender,
culture, faith or any type of disability.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Recommendation 9 Deliver very brief, brief,
extended brief and high intensity behaviour change
interventions and programmes
Commissioners and providers of behaviour change services should:
• Encourage health, wellbeing and social care staff (see who should take action?) in
direct contact with the general public to use a very brief intervention to motivate
people to change behaviours that may damage their health. The interventions should
also be used to inform people about services or interventions that can help them
improve their general health and wellbeing.
• Encourage staff who regularly come into contact with people whose health and
wellbeing could be at risk to provide them with a brief intervention. (The risk could be
due to current behaviours, sociodemographic characteristics or family history.)
• Encourage behaviour change service providers and other health and social care staff
dealing with the general public to provide an extended brief intervention to people
they regularly see for 30 minutes or more who:
－ are involved in risky behaviours (for example harmful drinking [high-risk drinking]the latest definitions on alcohol limits are described in the glossary of the NICE
guideline on alcohol use disorders: prevention)
－ have a number of health problems
－ have been assessed as being at increased or higher risk of harm
－ have been successfully making changes to their behaviour but need more support
to maintain that change
－ have found it difficult to change or have not benefited from a very brief or brief
intervention.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Encourage behaviour change service providers and practitioners to provide high
intensity interventions (typically these last more than 30 minutes and are delivered
over a number of sessions) for people they regularly work with who:
－ have been assessed as being at high risk of causing harm to their health and
wellbeing (for example, adults with a BMI more than 40 – see the NICE guideline
on obesity prevention) and/or
－ have a serious medical condition that needs specialist advice and monitoring (for
example, people with type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease) and/or
－ have not benefited from lower-intensity interventions (for example, an extended
brief intervention).

Recommendation 10 Ensure behaviour change is
maintained for at least a year
Providers and practitioners involved with behaviour change programmes and interventions
should help people maintain their behaviour change in the long term (more than 1 year) by
ensuring they:
• receive feedback and monitoring at regular intervals for a minimum of 1 year after they
complete the intervention (the aim is to make sure they can get help if they show any
sign of relapse)
• have well-rehearsed action plans (such as 'if–then' plans) that they can easily put into
practice if they relapse
• have thought about how they can make changes to their own immediate physical
environment to prevent a relapse
• have the social support they need to maintain changes
• are helped to develop routines that support the new behaviour (note that small,
manageable changes to daily routine are most likely to be maintained).

Recommendation 11 Commission training for all
staff involved in helping to change people's

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

behaviour
Commissioners, local education and training boards, and managers and supervisors (see
who should take action?) should:
• Commission training for relevant staff to meet the service specification for any
behaviour change intervention or programme. This should:
－ cover all the various activities, from a very brief intervention offered when the
opportunity arises to extended brief interventions
－ include assessment of people's behaviours and needs
－ address equity issues
－ provide the latest available evidence of effectiveness and describe how an
intervention works (mechanism of action).
• Ensure training programmes on behaviour change provide:
－ evidence-based content (see recommendation 7)
－ evidence-based training methods
－ trainers with proven skills, knowledge and experience (competencies) in the
particular area (see recommendation 12)
－ monitoring using relevant behaviour change competency frameworks or
assessment.
Commissioners and local education and training boards should:
• Ensure training programmes consider:
－ where programmes and interventions will be delivered
－ training participants' characteristics (such as background)
－ whether behaviour change is part of participants' main role, integral to their role
but not the main focus, or an additional task (see recommendation 9).

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Ensure training includes ongoing professional development on how to encourage
behaviour change. This could include regular refresher training to maintain the quality
of delivery of behaviour change interventions.
• Ensure training is evaluated in terms of outcomes (see recommendation 14) and
process (for example, via participant feedback).

Recommendation 12 Provide training for behaviour
change practitioners
Providers of behaviour change training should:
• Ensure training objectives include the range of knowledge and skills (competences)
needed to deliver specific interventions.
• Ensure practitioners are trained to adopt a person-centred approach when assessing
people's needs and planning and developing an intervention for them.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Ensure behaviour change practitioners:
－ understand the factors that may affect behaviour change, including the
psychological, social, cultural and economic factors (see recommendation 8)
－ are aware of behaviours that adversely affect people's health and wellbeing, and
the benefits of prevention and management
－ can address health inequalities by tailoring interventions to people's specific
needs, including their cultural, social and economic needs and other 'protected
characteristics'
－ are able to assess people's needs and can help select appropriate evidencebased interventions
－ know how an intervention works (mechanism of action)
－ recognise the specific behaviour change techniques used in the intervention they
will be delivering
－ understand how to access, and how to direct and refer people to, specialist
support services (for example, they should know how people can get help to
change their behaviour after hospitalisation, a routine GP appointment or an
intervention)
－ understand local policy and demographics.
• Ensure behaviour change practitioners have the skills to:
－ assess people's behaviour using validated assessment tools and measures
－ communicate effectively, for example, by giving people health, wellbeing and
other information, by using reflective listening and knowing how to show empathy
－ develop rapport and relationships with service users
－ develop a person's motivation to change by encouraging and enabling them to
manage their own behaviour (see recommendation 7)
－ deliver the relevant behaviour change techniques
－ help prevent and manage relapses (see recommendation 10).

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 20 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Ensure behaviour change practitioners who provide interventions to groups can:
－ elicit group discussions
－ provide group tasks that promote interaction or bonding
－ encourage mutual support within the group.
• Give practitioners the opportunity to learn how to tailor interventions to meet the
needs and preferences of different groups and to test this ability (both during and
after training).
• Ensure trainers have adequate time and resources to assess participants' motivation,
skills, confidence and knowledge when they are delivering interventions to particular
groups.

Recommendation 13 Provide training for health and
social care practitioners
All those who train or accredit health and social care professionals (see who should take
action?) should:
• Ensure behaviour change knowledge, skills and delivery techniques comprise a formal
element of initial training, work placements and ongoing continuous professional
development for all those who deliver health and social care services. (See
recommendation 12 for details of training content.)
• Ensure all health and social care professionals can, as a minimum, deliver a very brief
intervention. (Training modules can be found online, for example, see the National
Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training's very brief advice training module.)

Recommendation 14 Assess behaviour change
practitioners and provide feedback
Providers of behaviour change training should:
• Assess the ability of trainees to deliver behaviour change techniques and tailor
interventions to meet people's needs.

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 21 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Employers (this includes workplace managers, supervisors and mentors of trainees)
should:
• Ensure behaviour change practitioners who have received training are regularly
assessed on their ability to deliver behaviour change interventions. This ranges from a
very brief intervention to a high intensity intervention (the latter typically lasts longer
than 30 minutes and is delivered over multiple sessions). Assessment should reflect
the intervention content. It should also include practitioners' ability to provide
participants with behaviour change techniques and to tailor interventions to
participants' needs. In addition, it should include service user feedback.
Providers of behaviour change training and employers should:
• Ideally, record behaviour change sessions as part of the assessment. Intervention
components, such as behaviour change techniques, should be identified in transcripts.
Audio or video recording equipment could be used. If this is not possible then, as a
minimum, a reliable observation tool should be used to record the intervention. An
example of the latter would be a checklist of key intervention components.
• Obtain the consent of the practitioner and service user for all assessments. They
should also ensure the organisation's confidentiality requirements are met.
• Provide behaviour change practitioners with feedback on their performance, both
orally and in writing, starting with feedback on good performance. If necessary,
negotiate and set jointly agreed goals and an action plan. Provide them with the option
of refresher training.

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Recommendation 15 Monitor behaviour change
interventions
• Commissioners, providers and researchers (see who should take action?) should
ensure all interventions are monitored in terms of:
－ process measures (for example, uptake and reach of the intervention)
－ impact on health inequalities
－ behavioural outcomes in the short, medium and long-term
－ how closely they follow the intervention manual (intervention fidelity) (see
recommendation 6).
• If possible, providers should adapt existing electronic systems to collect data on the
behaviour of participants. For an example of what could be collected on smoking, see
the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training stop smoking service client
record form.

Recommendation 16 Evaluate behaviour change
interventions
• Before introducing a new intervention, commissioners and providers of behaviour
change interventions and researchers should be clear about the objectives and how
these will be measured and evaluated. (Researchers could include practitioners and
others; for more details see who should take action?) See Medical Research Council
guidance on the development, evaluation and implementation of complex
interventions to improve health.
• Commissioners and providers should ensure evaluation is carried out by a team of
researchers or an organisation that has not been involved in delivering the
intervention.
• Researchers should work with commissioners and providers to plan evaluation before
the intervention takes place. This may entail getting specialist input (for example, from
the National Institute for Health Research's research design service).

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Researchers should use objective, validated measures of outcome and process if they
are available. They should ensure the design makes it possible to provide new
evidence of effectiveness and, ideally, cost effectiveness – and details on why it is
effective (mechanism of action). See principles 7 and 8 in the NICE guideline on
behaviour change: general approaches.
• Commissioners, providers and researchers should ensure evaluation includes:
－ a description of the evaluation design
－ assessment of intervention fidelity
－ consistent use of valid, reliable measures (using the same tools to assess
behaviours) before, during and following an intervention (that is, ensuring baseline
and outcome measures match)
－ rigorous qualitative assessments to evaluate how well interventions will work in
practice and how acceptable they are to services users and practitioners
－ assessment of processes and outcomes using both objective and self-reported
measures
－ establishing and ensuring routine data collection
－ adequate sample sizes
－ assessment of long-term outcomes (more than 1 year).
• Providers of existing interventions should work with researchers to ensure they are
rigorously evaluated.

Recommendation 17 National support for behaviour
change interventions and programmes
• National organisations that support the monitoring, collection and surveillance of
routine data should work together to:
－ determine what routine data health, social care and voluntary organisations should
record on health-related behaviours (such as smoking and alcohol)
－ collect these data to monitor the outcomes of activities to improve the public's
health (include: behaviour change interventions; national, regional and local
policies and initiatives; and communication campaigns)
－ track the prevalence of these behaviours over time, region and social group and
report on findings
－ support local implementation of behaviour change interventions based on
evidence of effectiveness.
• National organisations responsible for behaviour change training and curricula (see
who should take action?) should work together to:
－ provide a central repository for behaviour change training curricula
－ assess whether behaviour change competency frameworks and training curricula
promote an evidence-based approach to behaviour change
－ provide guidance on the suitability of these frameworks and curricula in terms of
who they are aimed at and whether their content is evidence based.

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• National organisations responsible for research funding should ensure research related
to behaviour change includes, as a minimum, details of:
－ intervention content and how it was delivered
－ who delivered the intervention
－ format (methods by which the intervention was administered)
－ where and when the intervention was delivered
－ recipients
－ intervention intensity and duration
－ intervention fidelity.

Terms used in this guideline
Behaviour change competency frameworks
Behaviour change competency frameworks describe the knowledge and skills required to
deliver interventions to people to help them change their behaviour (Dixon and Johnston
2010).

Behaviour change interventions
Behaviour change interventions involve sets of techniques, used together, which aim to
change the health behaviours of individuals, communities or whole populations.

Behaviour change practitioner
Anyone who delivers behaviour change techniques and interventions can be a behaviour
change practitioner, regardless of their professional background, as long as they have
received specific training in these techniques. However, not all practitioners can deliver all
interventions or techniques.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Behaviour change programme
Behaviour change programmes are a coordinated set of more than one intervention that
share common aims and objectives.

Behaviour change techniques
The term 'behaviour change technique' is used in this guidance to mean the component of
an intervention that has been designed to change behaviour, such as social support. The
technique must meet specified criteria so that it can be identified, delivered and reliably
replicated. It should also be observable and irreducible (behaviour change techniques are
the smallest 'active' component of an intervention.) They can be used alone or in
combination with other behaviour change techniques.

Brief intervention
A brief intervention involves oral discussion, negotiation or encouragement, with or
without written or other support or follow-up. It may also involve a referral for further
interventions, directing people to other options, or more intensive support. Brief
interventions can be delivered by anyone who is trained in the necessary skills and
knowledge. These interventions are often carried out when the opportunity arises,
typically taking no more than a few minutes for basic advice.

Capability, opportunity and motivation
For any change in behaviour to occur, a person must:
• Be physically and psychologically capable of performing the necessary actions.
• Have the physical and social opportunity. People may face barriers to change because
of their income, ethnicity, social position or other factors. For example, it is more
difficult to have a healthy diet in an area with many fast food outlets, no shops selling
fresh food and with poor public transport links if you do not have a car.
• Be more motivated to adopt the new, rather than the old behaviour, whenever
necessary.
This is known as the COM-B model (Michie et al. 2011d).

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Choice architecture interventions
In this guidance, 'choice architecture intervention' is used to mean changing the context in
which someone will make a decision in order to influence how they act. For example,
placing healthier snacks closer to a shop checkout and putting sugary and high-fat options
out of reach may influence people to make a healthier choice because it is more
accessible. Behaviour change approaches based on choice architecture are also referred
to as 'nudge' or 'nudging' interventions (Thaler and Sunstein 2008).

Community-level interventions
A community-level intervention targets a particular community in a specific geographic
area, or with a shared identity or interest. For example, it could involve addressing local
infrastructure and planning issues that discourage people in a specific geographical area
from cycling. This could include ensuring local facilities and services are easily accessible
by bicycle and changing the layout of roads to improve safety and reduce traffic speeds.

Co-produce
Co-production means ensuring public services are developed and delivered by
professionals, people using the services, their families and their neighbours working
together in an equal and reciprocal way to agree what is needed, where and how.

Extended brief intervention
An extended brief intervention is similar in content to a brief intervention but usually lasts
more than 30 minutes and consists of an individually-focused discussion. It can involve a
single session or multiple brief sessions.

Feedback and monitoring
In 'feedback and monitoring' a specific behaviour (for example, alcoholic drinks consumed)
or outcome (for example, changes in weight following changes to diet) is recorded. The
person trying to change their behaviour is given feedback on the recorded behaviour or
outcomes (for example, measurement of weight) or comment on progress towards a set
goal. Monitoring can be done by a third party, or by the person themselves ('selfmonitoring').

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Goals and planning
'Goals and planning' refers to a group of behaviour change techniques that help people to
set goals for their behaviour or for an outcome of the behaviour (such as weight loss) and
plan how these goals will be met. Action plans include a description of what will happen in
what situation or at what time: how often it will happen, for how long, and where it will take
place. Behaviour goals are reviewed regularly in the light of experience and further plans
are made according to past progress towards goals.

Independent evaluation
Independent evaluations are conducted by someone who is not involved in commissioning
or delivering an intervention and does not have a vested interest in the outcome.
Evaluations can look at process or outcome and answer such questions as:
• Was an intervention delivered according to the plan or service specification?
• What changes were there in the behaviour of, or health outcomes for, service users?
• Why did the planned intervention lead (or not lead) to changes in behaviour or health
outcomes?

Individual-level behaviour change interventions
In this guidance, 'individual-level behaviour change intervention' is used to mean action
that aims to help someone with a specific health condition, or a behaviour that may affect
their health. It can be delivered on a one-to-one, group or remote basis, but the focus is
on creating measurable change in a specific person. A nutritional intervention offered to
anyone with a specific biomarker (for example, a specific body mass index) or health
status (for example, obesity) is an example. However, a nutritional intervention offered to
everyone in the country, or a particular city, is not. Although delivered to an individual, the
intervention may affect a whole group or population.
The interventions referred to throughout the guidance include one or more behaviour
change technique.

Intervention fidelity
Intervention fidelity is the degree to which the planned components of an intervention

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

have been delivered as intended.

Logic model
Logic models are narrative or visual depictions of real-life processes leading to a desired
result. Using a logic model as a planning tool allows precise communication about the
purposes of a project or intervention, its components and the sequence of activities
needed to achieve a given goal. It also helps to set out the evaluation priorities right from
the beginning of the process.

Motivation
Motivation is the process that starts, guides and maintains goal-related behaviour, for
example making changes to diet and exercise to lose weight. It involves biological,
emotional, social and cognitive forces.

Outcomes
Outcomes are the impact that a test, treatment, policy, programme or other intervention
has on a person, group or population. Outcomes from interventions to improve the public's
health could include changes in their knowledge and behaviour leading to a change in their
health and wellbeing.

Person-centred approach
Using a 'person-centred' approach, services work in collaboration with service users as
equal partners to decide on the design and delivery of services. This approach takes into
account people's needs and builds relationships with family members. It also takes into
account their social, cultural and economic context, motivation and skills, including any
potential barriers they face to achieving and maintaining behaviour change. Personcentred care involves compassion, dignity and respect.

Population-level interventions
Population-level interventions are national policies or campaigns that address the
underlying social, economic and environmental conditions of a population to improve
everyone's health. This type of intervention could include, for example, distributing leaflets

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 30 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

to the whole population highlighting the importance of being physically active, adopting a
healthy diet and being a healthy weight.

Proportionate universalism
In a proportionate universalist approach, interventions are delivered to the whole
population, with the intensity adjusted according to the needs of specific groups (for
example, some groups may need more frequent help and advice). This type of approach
can help to reduce the social gradient and benefit everybody.

Social support
Social support involves friends, relatives, or colleagues providing support for people who
want to change their behaviour (for example, to quit smoking). It can take the form of:
• Practical help (for example, helping someone to free up the time they need to get to a
service or use a facility, or helping them to get there).
• Emotional support (for example, a partner or friend could go walking or cycling with
the person on a regular basis if they want to get physically fit).
• Praise or reward for trying to change, whatever the result. (For example, a partner or
friend could make sure they congratulate the person for attempting to lose weight or
stop smoking.)

Taxonomy
A taxonomy is a system of naming, describing and classifying techniques, items or objects.
For example, a website taxonomy includes all the elements of a website and divides them
into mutually exclusive groups and subgroups. An example of a behaviour-change
technique taxonomy that can be applied across behaviours is described in Michie et al.
2013.

Very brief intervention
A very brief intervention can take from 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. It is mainly
about giving people information, or directing them where to go for further help. It may also
include other activities such as raising awareness of risks, or providing encouragement

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

and support for change. It follows an 'ask, advise, assist' structure. For example, very brief
advice on smoking would involve recording the person's smoking status and advising them
that stop smoking services offer effective help to quit. Then, depending on the person's
response, they may be directed to these services for additional support.

Who should take action?
Introduction
The guidance is for: commissioners, managers, training and education organisations,
service providers and practitioners with public health as part of their remit working within
local authorities, the NHS, and the wider public, private, voluntary and community sectors.
It is particularly aimed at those who commission, design, investigate and deliver
interventions to help people change their behaviour – or who encourage or support
behaviour change as part of their role. This includes those who provide training on
behaviour change.
The guidance may also be of interest to policy makers, researchers, individuals, groups or
organisations wishing to work in partnership with health and social care and other service
providers. In addition, it may be of interest to people who want to change their behaviour
(for example, to stop smoking), their families and other members of the public.

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Context
Introduction
Practitioners use a range of interventions when working with someone to improve their
health. Each intervention will usually involve one or more behaviour change techniques.
However, there is a lack of practical advice on which techniques should be used to tackle
specific behaviours (for example, in relation to diet, smoking and alcohol) and with people
from specific populations or with particular risk factors.
For an individual to improve their health in the medium and long term, behaviour change
must be sustained. Maintaining changes to behaviour can involve both helping people to
deal with relapses, and ensuring that new behaviours become habitual.
Sustained behaviour change is most likely to occur when a combination of individual,
community and population-level interventions are used. In addition, there is a reasonable
evidence base relating to motivation to change (Lai et al. 2010; Ruger et al. 2008).
In 2011, the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee reviewed a range
of factors that impact on behaviour change. In its final report, the Committee
recommended that NICE should update its guidance on the topic; in particular it wanted,
'more explicit advice on how behaviour change techniques could be applied to reduce
obesity, alcohol abuse and smoking' (House of Lords 2011).

Classifying behaviour-change techniques
Considerable research has been undertaken to specify behaviour change interventions in
terms of their component parts. This has led to a definition of behaviour change
techniques relevant for a range of health behaviours (Michie et al. 2013) and for specific
behaviours:
• to improve their diet or encourage physical activity (Abraham and Michie 2008; Conn
et al. 2002; Inoue et al. 2003; Michie et al. 2011a)
• to prevent weight gain (Hardeman et al. 2000)

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• to stop smoking (Michie et al. 2011b)
• to reduce alcohol intake (Michie et al. 2012)
• to prevent HIV (Albarracin et al. 2005).
Work is currently underway to explore the extent to which techniques may be applicable
across different behaviours. The classification system has been shown to be reliable. Its
validity is now being assessed (Michie et al. 2013).

Theoretical frameworks
The importance of having a theoretical basis for the design and evaluation of interventions
is well established (Medical Research Council 2008; Craig et al. 2008). For example, it can
help ensure better outcomes (Albarracin et al. 2005) as well as providing a means of
understanding why an intervention is effective or not.
Work has been done to establish theoretical frameworks for behaviour change (Abraham
and Michie 2008; Michie et al. 2011a; West 2009) and evidence continues to emerge about
these theories (Tuah et al. 2011; Williams and French 2011).

Considerations
Background
This section describes the factors and issues the Programme Development Group (PDG)
considered when developing the recommendations. Please note: this section does not
contain the recommendations.
There is a wealth of information and recommendations in existing NICE guidance on
interventions related to the behaviours covered in this guidance: alcohol use, eating
patterns, physical activity, sexual behaviour and smoking. The PDG did not aim to update
or critique these recommendations. Rather, it considered new evidence to add value to the
recommendations already made.
The PDG agreed that the principles in the NICE guideline on behaviour change: general
approaches relevant to the remit of this guidance were still applicable. These were:
principles 1 (planning), 3 (education and training), 4 (individual-level behaviour change
© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 39 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

interventions and programmes), 7 (effectiveness) and 8 (cost-effectiveness).
This guidance focuses mainly on individual-level behaviour change interventions. However,
the PDG agreed that these need to be viewed in the context of a range of other
interventions. This includes those delivered at population and community level and those
related to the environments in which choices about behaviours take place (see the NICE
guideline on behaviour change: general approaches).
The PDG noted that tackling behaviour change among people younger than 16, in
particular in relation to issues such as alcohol use and sexual risk-taking, is important.
However, this was not part of the remit for this guidance.
The PDG used various terms to describe the target group of an intervention. It did not feel
that any term was preferable and used 'participants' and 'service users' interchangeably.
The PDG discussed the role of commercial companies in contributing to behaviour change
and the potential contribution they could make to behaviour change interventions.
Suppliers and manufacturers could, for example, provide (free of charge) useful data to aid
understanding about behaviours such as alcohol use or eating patterns.
The PDG agreed that some of the recommendations were ambitious and may prove
difficult to resource at local level. However, it was keen to set a 'gold standard' for service
delivery as an aspirational target.

Evidence
The PDG did not think it was useful to look at specific behaviour change techniques in
isolation. The Group agreed that single technique interventions may be effective for some
people (or with some behaviours). However, it also noted that behaviour change often
comes about because of a range of techniques working together (as well as other factors,
such as context). The question is, which behaviour change techniques work most
effectively together? The Group noted that theories of behaviour change may help
determine which techniques should work synergistically.
The PDG noted that there was evidence of effectiveness for the behaviour change
techniques recommended in relation to specific behaviours. However, the Group also
noted, that the effectiveness of techniques across behaviours and populations was not
always clear or necessarily supported by the evidence.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

The behaviour change techniques taxonomy used in the evidence reviews (Michie et al.
2013) helped in discussions and in informing the evidence synthesis. However, the PDG
had some concerns about the findings reported in review 2. This was due to the quality of
reporting in intervention studies and the associated difficulty of coding behaviour change
techniques on the basis of limited information. First, variations in reporting behaviour
change techniques in the published data posed challenges when trying to provide
consistent coding across interventions. Second, many tests were undertaken in the
analysis in which behaviour change technique data were pooled across interventions for
different behaviours and populations. This, combined with coding issues, could lead to the
wrong conclusion concerning whether or not a technique is associated with behaviour
change. Third, the potential moderating effect of other variables (such as mode of delivery
and intervention intensity) was not addressed in the review analysis.
The authors of review 2 coded the behaviour change techniques used for 'usual care' and
the 'control arm' in each study. This was to ensure all the behaviour change techniques
used (in both the intervention and comparator) in any study were included in the metaregression analysis. The accuracy of this coding was, however, dependent on the level of
detail provided in published studies about the control arm. The PDG noted that, as with
the reporting of interventions in published research, detail about control arms was often
poor or missing. Generally there was not enough specific detail.
The PDG did not think recommendations could be based solely on the findings of the
meta-regression analysis in evidence review 2. It noted that this review provided evidence
of the effect sizes of behaviour change interventions and details of the behaviour change
techniques used.
The PDG agreed that triangulation – looking for consistent effects across the different
evidence considered by the group – would be appropriate. Consequently, if specific
behaviour change techniques were evident in effective interventions in the evidence
reviews and expert testimony, these findings were used as the basis for
recommendations.
The PDG only made recommendations about behaviour change techniques that were
identified using the triangulation process. Hence, a particular technique may not be
recommended because of a lack of supporting evidence from more than one source,
rather than due to evidence that it is not effective.
The evidence reviews that informed this guidance were structured around the specific

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

taxonomy developed by Michie et al. (2013). While two-thirds of the possible behaviour
change techniques defined in the taxonomy were identified in the included evidence,
relatively few were identified often. This does not necessarily mean that techniques not
mentioned were not used in the interventions. It may be that they are not reported or
described in enough detail to be identified in published articles.
The lack of evidence on sexual behaviour in the commissioned reviews made it difficult for
the PDG to make recommendations on these interventions.
The PDG noted that interventions aimed at changing people's alcohol use, eating patterns,
physical activity, sexual behaviour and smoking are generally cost effective. The same is
true for a number of other health behaviours that have been subjected to research. The
Group also noted that there was little or no consistent association between the presence
of any one behaviour change technique (or cluster of techniques) and an intervention
being cost effective.

Developing policy and strategy
The PDG ensured the first recommendation highlights the need for an integrated
programme of population, community, organisational and individual-level behaviour
change interventions. It noted that interventions that target many levels simultaneously
tend to be the most effective.
The PDG noted that it was important for all policy and strategy to be in line with the
principles of proportionate universalism. This involves providing universal services and
additional tailored support to meet the particular needs and choices of those who may find
it difficult to use the services.
The PDG discussed whether practitioners and services should aim to change one
behaviour at a time or multiple behaviours at once. It also discussed the best strategy to
deal with multiple behaviours. Given the lack of evidence on the best approach, the Group
made a recommendation for further research.

Commissioning quality-assured behaviour change
programmes
The PDG was concerned that if private companies were commissioned to provide a

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

behaviour change service they may not share data because of commercial interests. It
noted the importance of data-sharing for the purposes of monitoring processes and
outcomes.
The PDG noted the importance of ensuring all behaviour change interventions and
programmes are conducted in an ethical manner. For example, this might involve ensuring
participants in an intervention are fully informed of its content and how their data may be
used. It might also involve ensuring national data protection and confidentiality policies are
met.
The PDG considered that sustained changes in behaviour (that is, the maintenance of
behaviour change) are vital to improve public health outcomes. It noted the need to plan
for this at the start. The Group also noted that measurable changes in health at a
population level may happen over the medium to long term, whereas changes in behaviour
of individuals could be detected over shorter time periods.
The PDG noted the importance of long-term evaluation of behaviour change interventions
and programmes. It also noted that, in reality, effectiveness is often not assessed beyond
6–12 weeks following an intervention.
The PDG noted that details of various study designs, their internal validity, and how to
assess the quality of a study can be found in appendix D of Methods for the development
of NICE public health guidance (third edition).

Designing behaviour change interventions
The PDG noted that the majority of published journal articles on behaviour change
interventions do not provide enough detail to determine the techniques used in
intervention and control groups. Where detail is provided, it may reflect the topic covered.
For example, scientific studies on alcohol are based on a more standardised way of
reporting than, say, scientific studies within the sexual health field. The Group discussed
the need for manuals providing practical detail of the intervention techniques used, and for
these to be made publicly available.
The PDG noted that a lack of detail in published journal articles on studies claiming to use
motivational interviewing had affected the Group's ability to determine the behaviour
techniques used. The PDG recognised that motivational interviewing is based on a clear
set of principles and components. But as the articles did not specify which principles and

components were used, the Group could not assume that motivational interviewing was
used. This made it impossible to recommend this approach. It also added further support
to the Group's recommendation that manuals should provide details of all the intervention
components used.
The PDG acknowledged stakeholder concerns about intellectual property, copyright issues
and the potentially inappropriate use of the information kept in manuals on behaviour
change interventions. (For example, someone may use the information to set up their own
commercial behaviour change intervention without having had the appropriate training
needed to deliver it.) However, it was generally agreed that it was important to make
manuals for all interventions publicly available, for example, as a condition of funding for
projects in receipt of public monies.
As most journals now have web supplements, the PDG noted that it is possible to provide
detailed reports of intervention designs, whatever the word limit of the main paper. The
PDG discussed the fact that some journals only publish evaluations of interventions that
come with publicly available manuals detailing the full protocols used. It welcomed this
practice.
The recommendations contained in this guidance reflect the PDG's conclusions about
intervention planning, based on the evidence considered. However, the PDG recognised
that a number of other planning tools and resources – for example, 'intervention mapping'
(Bartholomew et al. 2011) – could be systematically employed to enhance intervention
design and effectiveness (see 4.31 below).
Intervention mapping aids collaborative planning by people from different professional
backgrounds during intervention development. The approach proposes 6 intervention
design stages:
• Stage 1: A needs assessment determines what (if anything) needs to be changed for
whom.
• Stage 2: Primary and secondary intervention objectives are defined. This involves
specifying the precise behaviour changes participants will be expected to make.
• Stage 3: Designers identify the underlying evidence-based techniques that maintain
current (unwanted) behaviour patterns and may generate the specified changes.

conditions#notice-of-rights).

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

• Stage 4: Practical ways of delivering these techniques are developed and integrated
into the intervention.
• Stage 5: How the intervention will be used or delivered in everyday contexts is
considered.
• Stage 6: Evaluation to assess whether the intervention changed specified behaviours
in context.
These stages are iterative in that, for example, anticipation of how the intervention will
be used or delivered may lead to a change in design and a return to stage 4. Similarly,
when the exact behaviour changes are defined in stage 2, these may need to be
evaluated. The result is an intervention 'map' of matrices and plans that guide the
design, implementation and evaluation of an intervention.
The PDG noted the importance of not just the content of an intervention, but who is
delivering it (and their core competencies), to whom, how and where.
The PDG discussed the importance of making sure all key components of a given
intervention are adopted so that they have high intervention fidelity and are sustainable.
The PDG agreed that a behaviour change taxonomy for designing interventions was a
useful tool. However, the Group was clear that the inclusion of a behaviour change
technique in a taxonomy did not necessarily mean there was a strong evidence base for
that technique.

Delivery
Evidence showed that behaviour change interventions by GPs and other medical staff can
be effective. However, the PDG felt that a focus solely on such interventions may lead to a
widening in health inequalities, because people from the most vulnerable groups often do
not use primary care services. The Group did not want to exclude such interventions,
rather it raised the need to find alternative ways of reaching vulnerable groups. Members
agreed that understanding how people come into contact with, and access, services was
key to the design of behaviour change interventions.
The PDG noted that details of validated tools and measures for assessing behaviour can
be found in academic publications. The Group also noted that specific assessment tools
have been recommended by NICE. For example, tools for assessing alcohol use are

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

recommended in the NICE guideline on alcohol-use disorders: prevention.
The PDG agreed that although information is usually a necessary precursor to behaviour
change, information alone is not always sufficient to influence behaviour.
The PDG noted that social, economic and cultural contexts can have an impact on
behaviour. Although a sense of connection and belonging at school, within the family or
community promotes resilience, unhealthy behaviour can also be embedded in social
processes and patterns. The Group also noted that diverse health outcomes can be
established early in life.

Behaviour change techniques
Recommendations were made to include goals and planning and feedback and monitoring
techniques in behaviour change interventions. This was based on a cross-examination of
behaviour change techniques identified in expert paper 14, the evidence reviews and the
NICE guideline on behaviour change: general approaches. (Triangulation techniques were
used.) The process indicated that the techniques would be effective as part of
interventions on alcohol, diet, physical activity and smoking. These behaviour change
techniques are described in detail in Michie et al. (2013).
Time constraints meant it was not possible to review additional evidence on sexual health
interventions and behaviour change techniques. However, the PDG noted that in existing
NICE guidance, social support was frequently used in effective interventions for all
behaviours (alcohol, diet, physical activity, sexual behaviour and smoking).
The PDG noted that social support provided by friends, family and associates could help
to create an environment in which people felt able to make changes. However, members
also noted that, if not managed effectively, social support provided by non-professionals
(such as family members) could sometimes lead to an unhealthy co-dependency, bullying,
manipulation or other negative behaviour.
The PDG noted that principle 4 (on individuals) in the NICE guideline on behaviour change:
general approaches recommended specific behaviour change techniques. The Group
agreed that, for consistency of approach, these would be 'coded' using the taxonomy
applied in the commissioned evidence reviews for this guidance (Michie et al. 2013). This
taxonomy identified the following groups of behaviour change techniques: goals and
planning, feedback and monitoring, social support, natural consequences, comparison of

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

behaviour, repetition and substitution and antecedents.
The PDG noted that interventions are unlikely to be effective if providers are not properly
trained or the setting is not appropriate. The Group also noted that some behaviour
change techniques, such as self-monitoring, might be difficult for some people.
The PDG was aware of a growing interest in the use of new technology, including phone
and tablet apps, to deliver behaviour change interventions. The Group noted that the
evidence is mixed and there have not been many formal evaluations of its effectiveness.
But it also noted that evidence to support the use of technology is encouraging (see
recommendation 7).

Training
The PDG noted the importance of training. For example, the Group discussed the fact that
if one person successfully trained 100 practitioners they, in turn, could help 10,000 people,
and the knock-on effects would be huge.
The PDG discussed the importance of communication skills when providing behaviour
change interventions. In particular, it noted the importance of knowing how to initiate a
conversation, develop rapport and communicate information effectively. Communication
skills include reflective listening, the use of open ended questions and affirmation skills.
The PDG did not discuss the accreditation of training. This may be an area where future
guidance is needed.
The PDG was concerned that training programmes still describe the stages of change
model (also known as the transtheoretical model) as a theoretical basis for behaviour
change interventions. The PDG wanted to highlight that, although it may help practitioners
and service users to understand the experience of behaviour change, it is not a theory
that is able to accurately explain and predict such change. It was noted that interventions
based on this model alone have not, according to the evidence reviewed here,
demonstrated effectiveness.
The PDG was clear that being trained to deliver one behaviour change intervention does
not necessarily mean that a practitioner is then competent to deliver other behaviour
change interventions. The Group was aware of the danger that practitioners and service
users may assume their competency extends further than it actually does.

conditions#notice-of-rights).

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

The PDG noted that behaviour change training is a behaviour change intervention in its
own right.

Evaluation
The PDG noted that this guidance is not intended to make recommendations on how to
undertake research in this area.
The PDG noted that well-conducted evaluation studies and randomised controlled trials –
with minimal bias – give the best quality evidence. Anecdotal evidence and smaller or
poorly conducted studies are much less reliable and the Group agreed that it was best not
to use these as a basis for investment decisions. The Group also noted that NICE, NHS
Evidence and the Cochrane Collaboration provide guidance to help identify behaviour
change interventions or programmes to invest in for a particular topic, population or
setting.
The PDG noted that qualitative, as well as quantitative, measures are important when
trying to understand why something does or does not work – and under what
circumstances. They can also help to identify any improvements or changes that need to
be made.
The PDG noted that the setting where an intervention is delivered and the person
delivering it may be the two main factors that make an intervention effective (or
ineffective).
The PDG discussed the meaning of independent evaluation. The Group was clear that this
was not synonymous with external evaluation. Rather, it could be carried out inside an
organisation as long as it was not conducted by those actually involved in designing or
delivering the intervention.

National support
The PDG noted that local organisations may need support to help them decide on the
most appropriate behaviour change interventions and training to commission or provide in
their area. Members discussed how a unified national approach might achieve this, with
organisations and research funders working together to ensure appropriate data
collection, evaluation and dissemination of evidence. The PDG also noted that some

© NICE 2023. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 48 of
conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

organisations, for example Public Health England and NICE (through NICE evidence
services) are already working towards this goal.

Choice architecture
On the basis of current evidence, the PDG felt that it would be premature to make any
recommendations on the use of choice architecture interventions (see expert paper 8). As
a result, only research recommendations were made on this.
A scoping review of the evidence base for choice architecture interventions targeting
healthy behaviour indicated that the majority of evidence involved diet (see expert paper
8). However, in the absence of a full systematic review, the PDG questioned whether such
interventions did lead to a healthy diet.
The PDG noted that, in the context of choice architecture, 'doing nothing' is not a neutral
approach, because this simply maintains the status quo. And the status quo may, for
example, be an 'obesogenic environment' constructed by commercial interests.
The PDG recognised that choice architecture interventions may appeal to people working
in a local authority setting. The reasons are twofold. First, this type of behaviour change
intervention may be perceived to be relatively low cost. Second, it has the potential to
reach a relatively large number of people. However, there is only limited evidence on how
effective these interventions are at changing health-related behaviour. The PDG agreed
that anyone wishing to commission or provide such an intervention as part of a behaviour
change service should be aware of this lack of evidence. The Group agreed that choice
architecture interventions, if used, needed to be subject to independent evaluation.
Although the PDG was not able to make recommendations on choice architecture
interventions, members noted that a further evidence synthesis on this approach is due to
be published soon. The PDG advised that if this synthesis is published prior to the routine
update of this guidance, the update should be bought forward.

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

Recommendations for research
The Programme Development Group (PDG) recommends that the following research
questions should be addressed. It notes that 'effectiveness' in this context relates not only
to the size of the effect, but also to cost effectiveness and duration of effect. It also takes
into account any harmful or negative side effects.
All the research should aim to identify differences in effectiveness among groups, based
on characteristics such as socioeconomic status, age, gender and ethnicity.
1. Which choice architecture interventions help to reduce increased-risk and higher-risk
drinking of alcohol, improve sexual health behaviours, help stop or reduce smoking, or
increase the physical activity levels of the general UK population? How is this related to
sociodemographic variables?
2. What evidence of effectiveness is there on the use of choice architecture interventions
in commercial settings to influence health-related behaviours? How can findings from
commercial settings support non-commercial choice architecture approaches to support
behaviour change to improve health?
3. Which combinations of behaviour change techniques and modes of delivery are
effective and cost effective in initiating particular behaviour changes, and in maintaining
those changes? How does this vary among people from different socio-demographic
groups or with different levels of motivation, access to information or skills? Include
research that builds the evidence base on the effectiveness of each behaviour change
technique. For example, experimental and meta-analytic work could clarify which
behaviour change techniques work when, and for whom.
4. Which behaviour change interventions and programmes are effective and cost effective
at changing multiple behaviours and maintaining behaviour change? How does this vary
among people from different sociodemographic groups?
5. What characteristics of behaviour change training influence the effectiveness of
behaviour change practitioners?
6. How effective and cost effective are behaviour change interventions delivered remotely
(that is, by telephone, text message, phone and tablet apps or the internet)? How does

this vary among behaviours and among people from different sociodemographic groups?
7. How do behaviour change techniques lead to change? What are the best methods of
testing the relationship between the theories that describe change processes and the
effectiveness of interventions in practice?
More detail identified during development of this guidance is provided in gaps in the
evidence.

The evidence
Introduction
The evidence statements from 3 reviews are provided by external contractors (see
supporting evidence).
This section lists how the evidence statements and the expert papers link to the relevant
recommendations. It also sets out a brief summary of findings from the economic analysis
and the fieldwork.

How the evidence and expert papers link to the
recommendations
The evidence statements are short summaries of evidence, in a review, report or paper
(provided by an expert in the topic area). Each statement has a short code indicating
which document the evidence has come from. The letters in the code refer to the type of
document the statement is from, and the numbers refer to the document number, and the
number of the evidence statement in the document.
Evidence statement number 1.1 indicates that the linked statement is numbered 1 in
review 1. Evidence statement number 2.1.3 indicates that the linked statement is
numbered 1.3 in review 2. Evidence statement number 3.3.4 indicates that the linked
statement is numbered 3.4 in review 3. EP1 indicates that expert paper 1 is linked to a
recommendation.
The reviews, expert papers and economic analysis are available. Where a recommendation
is not directly taken from the evidence statements, but is inferred from the evidence, this
is indicated by IDE (inference derived from the evidence).

Economic analysis
Review 1 identified 79 interventions dealing with 6 behaviours: smoking, diet, physical
activity, alcohol, sexual health and multiple health targets. All interventions fall well below
the accepted £20,000–£30,000 costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold.
However, sensitivity analyses suggest that some may have incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) above this threshold. In this review, sexual health interventions were least

conditions#notice-of-rights).
62

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

cost effective but no other characteristics or behaviour change techniques were related to
cost-effectiveness estimates.
Review 2 identified 251 interventions across the 6 behaviours, of which 102 provided
cost–utility estimates (£/QALY). Using the upper estimate and lower threshold (the most
cautious approach), 85% of interventions were identified as cost effective. Using the lower
estimates, smoking cessation interventions were significantly more cost effective than
interventions targeting multiple behaviours.
Across all interventions, those targeting the general population had better cost–utility
results and were more likely to be cost effective than those aimed at vulnerable
populations. Regression analyses across, as well as within, behaviours suggests there is
little or no consistent association between the presence of an individual behaviour change
technique (or cluster of behaviour change techniques) and an intervention being cost
effective.
The authors of the reviews state that the findings need to be interpreted cautiously given:
• the different search strategies for reviews 1 (based on interventions already assessed
by NICE as cost effective) and 2 (based on the search strategy used for evidence
review 2)
• reliance on incomplete information in published papers
• heterogeneity in economic analyses
• lack of consensus for a definition of 'choice architecture'
• bias in reporting of study findings.

Fieldwork findings
Fieldwork aimed to test the relevance, usefulness and feasibility of putting the
recommendations into practice. The PDG considered the findings when developing the
final recommendations.
Fieldwork participants who are involved in, or support, behaviour change activities were
fairly positive about the recommendations and their potential to help change an
individual's behaviour. This included practitioners, commissioners, service providers,

Behaviour change: individual approaches (PH49)

health and wellbeing board members, national bodies (from both the public and private
sectors), royal colleges and academics.
Many participants welcomed the emphasis on evidence-based investment, but were keen
to ensure this should not stifle innovation or narrow the options available to
commissioners.
They described the commissioning recommendations as bold and ambitious. While
recognising that they may be difficult to implement in the current climate, participants did
not believe the approach should be diluted.
There were some concerns that independent evaluation may be viewed as unaffordable. It
was suggested that evaluation should be built into the original design or service
specification to ensure it does take place.
Fieldwork participants did not think the recommendations offered a new approach, but
they agreed that the measures had not been implemented universally. They believed
wider, more systematic implementation would be achieved if there was a clearer definition
of the techniques and training requirements for staff and commissioners.

Gaps in the evidence
The Programme Development Group (PDG) identified a number of gaps in the evidence
related to the programmes under examination based on an assessment of the evidence.
These gaps are set out below.
1. There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of using choice
architecture interventions to change alcohol, sexual health behaviours, smoking and
physical activity-related behaviours (with the exception of choice architecture
interventions to promote stair use). In particular, there is a lack of UK-based primary
research exploring the differential impacts of such interventions. (Source: Expert paper 8)
2. There is a lack of evaluation, using appropriate research designs, of choice architecture
interventions used in commercial settings to determine their effectiveness, costeffectiveness or usability in non-commercial settings. (Source: Expert paper 14)
3. There is a lack of review-level work and primary research examining the effectiveness of
individual behaviour change techniques. (Source: Expert paper 14)
4. There is a lack of evidence addressing what the most effective approach is to dealing
with multiple behaviours (for example, if someone smokes, consumes alcohol above
recommended weekly limits and is physically inactive). Specifically:
a) Should behaviours be approached in sequence or in combination?
b) If multiple behaviours are addressed in combination, how is this decided? For example,
is it based on the types of behaviour? How dependent is it on the person's capability,
opportunity and motivation?
(Source: Expert paper 14)
5. There is a lack of evidence prospectively investigating the relationship between
practitioner training, subsequent competencies and behaviour change interventions. In
particular, studies have not looked at the effect size of competencies or training. (Source:
Evidence review 3)
6. There is limited research on the training needed to address barriers to delivering

behaviour change interventions. (Source: Evidence review 3)
7. There is a lack of published research that provides details of the theoretical basis of an
intervention (beyond the naming of a theory). There is a lack of evidence on how
theoretical accounts of behaviour change can be used to guide evidence synthesis
(combining multiple sources of quantitative evidence, such as meta-regression, metaanalysis) of behaviour change interventions. (Source: Evidence review 2)
8. There is a lack of recent evidence (post-2003) on behaviour change techniques used to
influence sexual behaviour. In particular, there is a lack of UK randomised control trials
with populations aged 16 and over. (Source: Evidence review 2)
The Committee made 7 recommendations for research into areas that it believes will be a
priority for developing future guidance. These are listed in recommendations for research.

behaviour. The Capability-­Opportunity-­Motivation-­Behaviour (COM-­B) and its aschological and behavioural constructs in a consistent and transferable manner across
studies.
Aim: To identify oral and dental health-­related studies that have used the TDF and/
or COM-­B as frameworks to guide research and examine the ways in which these
concepts have been practically used in such research.
Method: Narrative review of published literature. To be included, the paper had to
(1) state that the TDF or COM-­B had been used and to have targeted at least one
construct identified in either framework, (2) include primary empirical data, (3) focus
on a behaviour directly related to oral or dental-­related health (eg brushing, applying fluoride varnish, flossing) and/or attitudes, intentions and beliefs related to the
behaviour. Studies could include any research design, and participants of any age or
gender and include patients, parents or dental health professionals.
Findings: Nine studies were identified that had drawn on the COM-­B and/or TDF
as the framework for their research. Seven of the studies were based on the TDF
only, with one employing both the COM-­B and Health Belief Model, and one using
the TDF with COM-­B. The nine studies covered a broad range of oral health-­related
behaviours including child tooth brushing, fluoride varnish application and non-­ or
micro-­invasive management of proximal caries lesions. The populations in the studies
included dentists, dental teams and parents of children. All studies adopted only a
subset of the constructs within the TDF, often without justification.
Conclusions: It is encouraging that oral health researchers are adopting standardized
psychological frameworks to develop their research and oral health interventions.
Future work should build on the small number of studies identified in this review and
consider using standardized tools to do so.

Understanding and changing eating behaviours are central to the work of Nutrition
Society members working in both research and applied settings. The present paper
describes a recently published resource to guide the design of interventions to change behaviour, The Behaviour Change Wheel: A Guide to Designing Interventions (BCW
Guide). This is a practical guide to intervention design that brings together recently-developed theory-based tools in behavioural science into a coherent step-by-step design process.
It is based on the BCW, a synthesis of nineteen frameworks of behaviour change found in
the research literature. The BCW has at its core a model of behaviour known as ‘capability’, ‘opportunity’, ‘motivation’ and ‘behaviour’. The model recognises that behaviour
is part of an interacting system involving all these components. The BCW identiﬁes different intervention options that can be applied to changing each of the components and policies that can be adopted to deliver those intervention options. The book shows how the
BCW links to theory-based frameworks to understand behaviour such as the Theoretical
Domains Framework and the recently developed Behaviour Change Technique
Taxonomy v1 for specifying intervention content. In essence, it shows how to link what
is understood about a given behaviour to types of intervention likely to be effective and
then translate this into a locally relevant intervention. In addition, the present paper sets
out some principles of intervention design.
Behaviour change: Intervention design: Eating behaviour

Evidence for the impact of eating behaviours on health is
overwhelming and alarming. A study of over 20 000 UK
adults reported that eating less than ﬁve portions fruit
and vegetables daily was associated with a signiﬁcantly
higher risk of mortality after 11 years compared with
adults who ate ﬁve or more portions daily (relative risk
1·44, 95 % CI 1·31, 1·59)(1).
Effective interventions are needed to change eating
behaviours. It is apparent that many interventions to
change behaviours are designed according to the
ISLAGIATT principle (a term coined by Martin
Eccles, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Effectiveness),
an acronym for ‘it seemed like a good idea at the
time’. This term is intended to encapsulate the nonsystematic, non-comprehensive approach to designing

interventions, essentially guessing at what might be
the solution without having understood the problem.
The present paper summarises a systematic, comprehensive method of intervention design described in
the recently published book The Behaviour Change
Wheel: A Guide to Designing Interventions (BCW
Guide)(2) which brings together recently developed
tools in behavioural science intended to be useful and
usable to those tasked with changing behaviour but
who do not necessarily have a background in behavioural science. The method is similar to that described
in a paper published in Nutrition Bulletin in 2012(3);
since then the methods have been reﬁned and examples
are included of how these tools and methods have been
used to understand and change eating behaviours.

Using theory in intervention design
The Medical Research Council has published guidance
on designing and evaluating complex interventions(4).
The BCW Guide puts ‘ﬂesh on the bones’ of this guidance, in particular where the Medical Research Council
guidance advocates the use of theory in intervention
design. Using theory in intervention design has a number
of beneﬁts: it can provide a framework to facilitate the accumulation of evidence, i.e. summarising what is known;
it can permit communication across research groups, i.e.
a common language; theory can be used as a starting
point for intervention design to identify what needs to
shift in order for behaviour to change and also in the
evaluation of interventions by identifying mechanism
of action, i.e. how an intervention is working. Two
theory-based tools are described in the present paper. A
companion to the BCW Guide, the ABC of Behaviour
Change Theories(5) summarises eighty-three theories identiﬁed in a cross-disciplinary project, drawing on psychology, sociology, anthropology and economics. The
component constructs for each theory are listed and
some guidance to their use is provided.

Designing interventions using the Behaviour Change
Wheel
The intervention design method described in the BCW
Guide is separated into three tasks for intervention
designers: (1) understand the behaviour; (2) identify

https://doi.org/10.1017/S0029665115000075 Published online by Cambridge University Press

intervention options; (3) identify content and implementation options. These tasks are described in greater detail.

Understand the behaviour
Deﬁne problem in behavioural terms. In the ﬁrst instance,
intervention designers are encouraged to deﬁne the problem in behavioural terms. There are two components to
this: (i) who is performing the behaviour and (ii) what
the behaviour is. The rationale for this is that if a problem is expressed in terms of outcome, e.g. weight gain,
this does not indicate what behaviours one is trying to
change or whose behaviour is involved. By stating for
example, that the ‘who’ is parents of obese children
and the ‘what’ is serving larger than recommended portion sizes there is now a behaviour to target.
Select a target behaviour. Behaviour does not occur in
a vacuum, it occurs within constantly evolving systems
and contexts. Fig. 1 gives an example of the interdependence of behaviours related to healthy eating.
Intervention designers are encouraged to begin by generating a list of all the potential behaviours that may be
relevant to the problem they are trying to solve. Then
consider each behaviour in terms of: the impact of changing the behaviour (what difference will it make?) the likelihood of changing the behaviour (to what extent can the
behaviour be easily changed?) and any spillover effect
(will changing the behaviour positively or negatively
inﬂuence other behaviours?). By considering these criteria, intervention designers can make pragmatic decisions on which behaviour to target.

L. Atkins and S. Michie

When tasked with designing interventions to change
behaviour designers will understandably want ‘value for
money’ and as such may seek to target multiple behaviours. Designers are encouraged to consider that it
may be more effective to intervene intensively on one
or two target behaviours and build on small successes
than to attempt to change too much too soon.
Specify the behaviour targeted for change. For
each target behaviour, intervention designers should specify the behaviour in terms of: (i) who needs to perform
the behaviour? (ii) what does the person need to do differently to achieve the desired change? (iii) when will
they do it? (iv) where will they do it? (v) how often will
they do it? (vi) with whom will they do it? Being more
or less speciﬁc is the difference between ‘eating healthier
foods’ and ‘Lou will eat no more than two cream cakes
per week for the next 3 months.’ Being more speciﬁc
about which behaviour(s) we are trying to change allows
us to be more focussed when it comes to understanding
these behaviours.
Identify what needs to change. We expect any medical
intervention to have been based on a diagnosis and the
diagnosis to be based on a thorough examination (or
analysis) of the problem. The same is true of designing
interventions to change behaviour. To change behaviour
we need to understand why behaviours are as they are
and what needs to shift for the desired behaviour to
occur. Answering these questions is helped by a model
of behaviour, the COM-B model(2,6). The initials stand
for capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour.
According to the model, behaviour is part of an interacting system involving all these components. Each component is divided into two types. Capability is divided into
physical (having the physical skills, strength or stamina
to perform the behaviour) or psychological (having the
knowledge, psychological skills, strength or stamina to
perform the behaviour). Opportunity is divided into
physical (what the environment allows or facilitates in
terms of time, triggers, resources, locations, physical barriers, etc.) or social (including interpersonal inﬂuences,
social cues and cultural norms). Motivation is divided
into reﬂective (involving self-conscious planning and evaluations (beliefs about what is good or bad)) or automatic (processes involving emotional reactions, desires,
impulses and reﬂex responses).
If more detail is needed to understand the behaviour,
the COM-B model components can be further elaborated
using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)(7).
The TDF is made up of fourteen domains synthesised
from 128 constructs taken from thirty-three theories of
behaviour and behaviour change: knowledge; skills;
memory, attention and decision processes; behavioural
regulation; social/professional role and identity; beliefs
about capabilities; optimism; beliefs about consequences;
intentions; goals; reinforcement; emotion; environmental
context and resources; and social inﬂuences. Explicit
links between TDF domains and the COM-B model
are given in the BCW Guide(2).
Using the COM-B model and/or TDF intervention
designers can make a behavioural diagnosis of what
needs to shift in order for the desired behaviour to

https://doi.org/10.1017/S0029665115000075 Published online by Cambridge University Press

occur. The COM-B model has been used in the development of two mobile applications to promote healthy eating behaviours(8,9). One application was designed to
support parents of overweight children in providing appropriate portion sizes across the ﬁve food groups(8).
The intervention designers ran focus groups with parents
of overweight children and asked about their capability,
opportunity and motivation to provide appropriate portion sizes. Parents responses to the focus group questions
resulted in the following behavioural diagnosis: psychological capability needed to shift as parents reported a
lack of knowledge and monitoring of appropriate food
portion sizes and difﬁculty understanding food packaging portion guidelines; reﬂective motivation needed to
shift as parents were not conﬁdent in their ability to provide correct portion sizes; social opportunity needed to
shift as partners were not always supportive of efforts
to provide appropriate portion sizes and continued to
give too big portion sizes. A questionnaire and an interview schedule have been developed to support intervention designers in making a behavioural diagnosis(2).
Identify intervention options
Having made a behavioural diagnosis, the next step is to
begin building the intervention. A systematic review
identiﬁed nineteen frameworks to guide intervention design and rated them according to whether they were comprehensive, coherently structured and linked to a model
of behaviour(6). None met all the criteria so the frameworks were synthesised and the resulting integrated
framework was the BCW (Fig. 2). The BCW is composed of the COM-B model at the hub of the wheel,
nine intervention functions form the inner ring and
seven policy categories form the outer ring of the
wheel. Since its publication in 2011, the original paper
reporting the BCW(6) has been accessed over 59 000
times and cited over 150 times. In addition to being
used to understand and change eating behaviours two
case studies in the BCW Guide show how it has been
used to improve paediatric health care in Kenya(10) and
promote adherence to guidelines for post-natal
depression(11).
Identify intervention functions. Intervention functions
are broad categories of means by which an intervention
can change behaviour. The nine intervention functions
resulting from the synthesis of nineteen frameworks are
provided in Table 1. The term ‘function’ is used rather
than ‘type’ or ‘category’ as an intervention may have
more than one function. For example, a mass media
campaign to promote healthy eating may contain an element that is educational (providing new information
on the beneﬁts of healthy eating) but also be presented
in a way that is intended to be persuasive (generating
feelings of worry about the health harms of eating high
fat foods). Thus it would be unhelpful to classify the
mass media campaign as either educational or persuasive; it would be more accurate to say that it served
both educational and persuasive functions.
Explicit links between the COM-B model and intervention functions suggest which functions are likely to

the behavioural diagnosis (Table 2). For example, if
the behavioural diagnosis to increase healthy eating in
adults in the workplace identiﬁed that they were not
prioritising doing this; this would be coded as reﬂective
motivation. According to the COM-B model/intervention function matrix, there are several functions
that could potentially bring about a shift in reﬂective
motivation (as denoted by the shaded cells). These are
education, persuasion, incentivisation or coercion.
Which of these functions might be most appropriate
depends on a number of contextual factors. The
APEASE criteria(2) has been developed to support intervention designers in making context-based decisions by
considering the following criteria: (i) affordability (can

(does it work?) (iv) acceptability (is it acceptable to
those receiving/delivering it and at a political level?) (v)
side-effects/safety (are there any unintended side-effects
or safety issues?) (vi) equity (does it advantage some
groups over others?).
Using the COM-B/intervention function matrix and
the APEASE criteria allows designers to be systematic
and take account of context in their selection of intervention functions.
Identify policy categories. Seven policy categories sit
on the outer layer of the BCW (see Table 3 for labels,
deﬁnitions and examples). These policy categories allow
the consideration of not only what function the

Explicit linkages between intervention functions and
policy categories are given Table 4.
Continuing the example in the previous step: if the intervention function persuasion were selected to change
the target population’s reﬂective motivation so they
prioritised healthy eating in the work place, policy categories that could potentially deliver that intervention
function would be communication/marketing, guidelines,
regulation, legislation and service provision. Applying
the APEASE criteria will help designers to select the
most appropriate for the context in which the intervention will be delivered.
Identify implementation options
Identify behaviour change techniques. Having selected
which functions an intervention will serve and which
policy categories are most appropriate to deliver those
functions, designers now need to select the behaviour
change techniques (BCT) that will bring about the
desired change. BCT are deﬁned as the ‘active ingredients’ in an intervention designed to bring about change.
Examples of BCT include: goal setting (behaviour),
deﬁned as setting or agreeing a goal deﬁned in terms of

https://doi.org/10.1017/S0029665115000075 Published online by Cambridge University Press

Establishing support services in workplaces,
communities, etc.

the behaviour to be achieved, e.g. agree a daily goal to
eat fresh fruit and vegetables at lunch and dinner; selfmonitoring of behaviour, deﬁned as establishing a
method for the person to monitor and record their behaviour(s) as part of a behaviour change strategy, e.g.
asking the person to record daily, in a diary, whether
they had eaten fresh fruit and vegetables at lunch and
dinner each day. The recently developed Behaviour
Change Technique Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1)(12) is composed of ninety-three BCT. The BCW Guide describes
how each BCT is linked to intervention functions and
provides a short-list of potential BCT. Designers are
again encouraged to use the APEASE criteria to help select from this short-list the most appropriate BCT for
their context. The BCTTv1 is available as an application(12) and the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change
has recently launched free online training to use the taxonomy (www.bct-taxonomy.com).
Identify mode of delivery. In addition to intervention
content, designers need to decide on the mode of delivery
for the intervention, for example, whether the intervention will be delivered face-to-face either to groups
or individuals or by website, mobile application, print
media to list a few of the options. A simple taxonomy
of modes of delivery is provided in the BCW Guide.
The sample principles apply here as in previous steps:

be comprehensive and consider all available options to

APEASE criteria to judge which mode of delivery is
most appropriate for the context.

Implementation
The present paper has described a method of designing
interventions in the context of changing eating behaviours using tools recently developed in behavioural science. The tools and method described here are, of course,
applicable to a wide range of behaviours in a variety of
contexts and there are common challenges in implementing behaviour change interventions. Two key challenges
are discussed brieﬂy here: (1) Implementing an intervention to change behaviour in a particular group is
likely to depend on changing behaviour of those delivering the intervention. For example, implementing an intervention in primary care to change eating behaviours
in patients with diabetes is reliant on primary care staff
(general practitioners, practice nurses and health care
assistants) changing their behaviour in order to deliver
the intervention. Identifying and addressing barriers
and facilitators to health professional change will support
implementation. (2) Related to the previous point is the
issue of ﬁdelity of intervention delivery. That is, the extent to which interventions are delivered as planned.
Monitoring ﬁdelity of delivery is encouraged in
Medical Research Council Guidance on intervention development and evaluation(4) and promotes accurate interpretation of outcomes and identiﬁcation of provider
training needs(13).

Summary
The key beneﬁt of using the BCW and the BCTTv1 is that
they encourage intervention designers to be comprehensive in considering all options to intervene and then to systematically select those that are most promising for the
context. It is not a ‘magic bullet’ but a system for making

As these technologies, the BCW and BCTTv1, are
relatively new, there are currently few examples of effective interventions developed using them. However, the
BCW and BCTTv1 can be retroﬁtted to existing reports
of existing interventions to better characterise their functions and specify active ingredients. This will permit a
more coherent synthesis of the evidence and identiﬁcation of interventions most effective in different populations and settings.

Abstract
Objective Synthesis that can filter the evidence from
multiple sources to inform the choice of intervention
components is highly desirable yet, at present, there are
few examples of systematic reviews that explicitly define
this type of synthesis using behaviour change frameworks.
Here, we demonstrate how using the Theoretical Domains
Framework (TDF) and the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW)
made it possible to bring together the findings from a
series of three interconnected systematic reviews on the
self-care of minor ailments (MAs) to inform the choice of
intervention components.
Method The TDF and the capability, opportunity,
motivation model of behaviour at the hub of the BCW were
used to synthesise the findings from the three reviews,
including syntheses of service-user views in interviews
(review 1, 20 studies) and surveys (review 2, 13 studies),
and evaluations of a range of interventions and services
(review 3, 21 studies).
Results The TDF and BCW approach provided a
systematic, structured and replicable methodology for
retrospectively integrating different types of evidence
within a series of systematic reviews. Several intervention
strategies, grounded in theory and discussed with key
stakeholders, were suggested, which can be implemented
and tested.
Conclusions This novel application of the TDF/BCW
approach illustrates how it can be used to bring together
quantitative and qualitative evidence to better understand
self-care behaviour for MAs within a systematic review
context. The TDF/BCW approach facilitated exploration of
the contradictions and gaps between the separate review
syntheses, and supported the identification of possible
intervention strategies, grounded in theory. The ongoing
development and refinement of this method is supported.

Introduction
In
developing
complex
(especially
behavioural) interventions, the synthesis of
multiple types of information, including data
from individual trials, surveys and interviews,
and systematic reviews of qualitative and
quantitative evidence, and other studies, is
often helpful, yet there are few established

Strengths and limitations of this study
►► A worked example of a systematic, replicable,

mixed-methods approach to identifying the determinants of the self-care of minor ailments.
►► Framing of the determinants, in terms of the
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and capability, opportunity, motivation model of behaviour,
supported the identification, using the Behaviour
Change Wheel (BCW) approach, of potential interventions that target the likely determinants of selfcare behaviour, allowing specific recommendations
to be made for intervention design and future research in this area.
►► Stakeholder involvement helped to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the results.
►► The relative novelty of the TDF/BCW approach, and
the inferential and speculative aspects of the analysis, mean that the results should be considered
cautiously.

methods of synthesis. By addressing the same
question from more than one perspective
or technique, the findings from different
methods can be compared and contrasted.
This process is known as triangulation.1 If
the findings across the different methods
are similar, or reinforce one another, then
the findings can be considered more robust
than those from each method alone.1 Framework synthesis uses an a priori ‘framework’2
and offers a highly structured approach to
triangulation. In the context of intervention
design, synthesis that can filter the evidence
from multiple sources in a way that can
inform the choice of intervention components is highly desirable yet, at present, there
are few examples of systematic reviews, which
explicitly define the methods to inform this
type of synthesis using behavioural change
frameworks.
Recent developments in the field of
behavioural change encourage a systematic
approach that has the potential to inform the

choice of intervention components through the identification of barriers to change and associated theoretical
change processes. Here, we report an extended version of
an overarching synthesis of three interconnected systematic reviews, undertaken by our team on the self-care of
minor ailments (MAs).3 These reviews, summarised in
table 1 (and reported in full elsewhere) were syntheses
of service-user views in interviews (review 1) and surveys
(review 2), and evaluations (review 3) of a range of interventions and services. The overarching synthesis used
the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)4 and the
Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW)5 to bring the reviews
together. 3
MAs have been defined as non-serious medical conditions (such as a sore throat or cough) that people can
care for by themselves using over-the-counter medicines,
with support from friends or family, or from self-care
services, such as community pharmacy, walk-in/urgent
care centres or telephone triage, such as National Health
Service (NHS) 111 (a non-emergency helpline), in the
UK. MAs do not require appointments with general practitioners (GPs) or attendance at accident and emergency
(A&E), yet they often place an unnecessary strain on
these overstretched services.6
Behavioural change
Behavioural change has been shown to be more effective if interventions are based on principles drawn from
evidence and theories of behaviour and behavioural
change.7 The TDF and BCW are recent developments in
this field that provide a systematic and theoretical basis
for understanding and changing behaviour. The TDF
simplifies 33 theories and 128 constructs, which may
explain behavioural change, into 14 domains underpinned by psychological theory.4 5 8 9 The 14 validated
2

domains are: (1) knowledge, (2) skills, (3) social/professional role and identity, (4) beliefs about capabilities, (5)
optimism, (6) beliefs about consequences, (7) reinforcement, (8) intentions, (9) goals, (10) memory, attention
and decision processes, (11) environmental context and
resources, (12) social influences, (13) emotion and (14)
behavioural regulation. These domains include individual-level factors, such as knowledge and skills (eg,
knowledge of self-care services), social factors (eg, social
support), and environment and resource factors (eg, cost
of treatment). They, therefore, prompt the consideration
of a wide range of influences. This is especially pertinent
when synthesising primary research within reviews, as
retrospective coding requires a sufficiently broad range
of domains.
The capability, opportunity, motivation model of
behaviour (COM-B) distills the TDF into three key
domains that interact to predict behaviour, including
people’s capability, motivation and opportunities for the
behaviour. The COM-B system forms the hub of the BCW5
(shown in figure 1, reproduced from Michie et al5) and, in
conjunction with the next layer of the BCW, can be used
to identify potentially relevant intervention functions,
based on the salient TDF and COM-B domains. The BCW
is, therefore, unique in that it helps to identify which
components need to change for the target behaviour(s)
to occur, and provides guidance on the strategies that can
be used to modify the behaviour.
The TDF has been successfully applied to characterise the determinants of a range of health behaviours
(including the management of lower back pain, dementia
and smoking cessation), examined through interview
and survey studies.10 The BCW has also received a lot of
interest since its initial 2011 publication, and has been

used to develop or study the implementation of interventions in healthcare settings.11 12 More recently, these
tools are being applied within the context of systematic reviews13 to identify the determinants of behaviour
and to deconstruct interventions, and link components
of interventions with effectiveness. To our knowledge,
however, there are no published examples that use the
TDF and BCW to bring together qualitative and quantitative evidence within a systematic review. In this proofof-concept study, we used the TDF and BCW to integrate
the findings from three systematic reviews that included
54 studies.

Aims
This research sought to apply the TDF, the COM-B system
of behavioural change and the associated BCW, as tools
for bringing together the quantitative and qualitative
findings from three systematic reviews on self-care for
MAs, to inform the choice of intervention components.

Method
Reviews included in the overarching synthesis
We conducted three syntheses of service-user views in
interviews (review 1, 20 studies) and surveys (review 2,
13 studies) that sought to explore the factors that may
influence self-care for MAs and evaluations (review 3, 21
studies)3 of the effectiveness of behavioural interventions
and services that support self-care for MAs (one study was
inlcuded in both the interveiw and survey synthesis). 3
These form the basis of the overarching synthesis reported
here. These reviews filled an evidence gap identified by a
comprehensive search of the literature in 2015, restricted
from 2000 onwards (see Richardson et al3 for full details).
This identified only one systematic review that had examined self-care for MAs in the UK. In this review by Paudyal
et al,14 31 studies of UK pharmacy-based MA schemes were
synthesised.
Richardson M, et al. BMJ Open 2019;9:e024950. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024950

How interventions were mapped (step 1)
The interview (review 1) and survey (review 2) reviews
were previously synthesised using the TDF.3 To make
the third review comparable, the evaluations of the 11
included interventions were mapped onto the TDF.
The 10 evaluations of services were not coded for BCTs
as the active ingredients concerned provider type (most
commonly nurses), delivery format (telephone or face
to face), and setting of treatment (general practice or
other) rather than treatment.
BCTs were coded for the self-care of MAs (encompassing a range of behaviours) by two researchers (MR
and CLK) and the number of papers that each BCT was
present in was recorded. All intervention characteristics
(including target behaviour(s), population, context,
provider, BCTs and control condition) were extracted
from the descriptions in the primary manuscripts. BCTs
were subsequently coded onto the TDF, drawing on the
results from an expert consensus exercise8 that linked
12 of the TDF domains to 59 BCTs from the BCTTV1. In
three educational interventions with multiple relevant
conditions, the one with the best intervention description
was included (to avoid double counting).
Tiangulation of findings using the TDF and COM-B system of
the BCW (step 2)
The TDF domains were mapped onto the COM-B system
for the syntheses of service-user views in interviews
(review 1) and surveys (review 2), and evaluations (review
3) of interventions, then cross-referenced and tabularised. Capability can be physical or psychological and

Figure 1

Overarching synthesis and behavioural analysis
The findings from the primary reviews3 were integrated
into three steps. In step 1, the content of the interventions evaluated in review 3 was coded for behavioural
change techniques (BCTs); defined using the BCT
Taxonomy V.1. (BCTTV1)9 BCTs were then mapped onto
the TDF framework (see labels and definitions, table 2).
In step 2, the findings from each review were mapped on
the COM-B system of the BCW and triangulated using
the TDF and COM-B systems. In step 3, the most relevant
determinants were mapped onto intervention functions
(specified by the BCW) to identify BCTs and intervention
strategies.
MR was involved in developing the training materials
for the BCTTV115 and has experience in training people
to use it, as well as in using the TDF16; CLK successfully
completed the online BCT training (available at http://
www.​bct-​taxonomy.​com/) and has experience in using a
priori frameworks to code data inductively. MR led all the
coding and mapping decisions, which were checked by
CLK. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved with a
third researcher (KS), where necessary. In cases where
there was no previous mapping, or the existing mapping
needed to be modified to the particular research context,
decisions were made by consensus among the team.
Each step is discussed in more detail, below.

represents an individual’s ability to carry out behaviour.
Opportunity reflects physical (eg, service opening times)
and social (eg, norms about taking care of children’s
health) features of the environment that influences the
behaviour. Motivation can be reflective or automatic and
characterises the brain processes that drive behaviour. We
drew on the links between the TDF and COM-B, identified by a group of experts in a consensus exercise (see
page 92 in the BCW guide).17
The extent to which the interventions (evaluated in
review 3) matched the implied recommendations of the
interviews and surveys was analysed, alongside an analysis
of whether or not interventions meeting such recommendations proved to be more effective. Statistical information (direction of effect sizes and associated p values of
the interventions) was extracted, where relevant, and
reported in online supplementary table 1 (see Richardson
et al, for full details including effect sizes and confidence
intervals3).
In the final stage of this step, themes within the
matrix were prioritised into salient domains. Themes
and subthemes were identified as important, based on a
concordance of findings across the reviews. Concordance
4

was defined as being identified in the interviews and
among a quarter or more of survey participants, and/or
where there was evidence of effectiveness in the evaluations of interventions (review 3).
BCTs and intervention strategies (step 3)
The next step was to identify the strategies that are likely
to be effective in promoting self-care for MAs. Nine intervention functions were specified in the BCW and mapped
on to the COM-B domains: education, persuasion, incentivisation, coercion, training, restriction, environmental
restructuring, modelling and enablement (see table 2.3
in the BCW guide17). Using the guidance from the BCW,
those intervention functions that were most likely to
address the key determinants of self-care behaviour (identified in the previous step) were selected. BCTs that were
linked to the intervention functions were identified using
the BCTTV19 and the results from an expert consensus
exercise that mapped BCTs onto intervention functions
(see table 3.3 in the BCW guide17). BCTs were selected,
therefore, to target the most salient determinants of selfcare for MAs identified in interviews, surveys and evaluations of interventions. This process was supported using

the acceptability, practicability, effectiveness/cost-effectiveness, affordability, safety/side-effects and equity
criteria (APEASE)17 in consultation with stakeholders
(see below), and the results were put into a matrix.
Patient and public involvement
Stakeholder involvement has been an important aspect
of this project, from the early planning stages through to
analysis and write-up of the study findings. Stakeholders
(n=5) (including representatives from the Department
of Health and Social Care (DHSC) policy teams, the
DHSC Policy Research Programme, NHS England, and
the Economic and Social Research Council) provided
feedback on the study protocol and helped to inform the
scope of the research topics and research questions. They
also met to review the study findings and to prioritise the
behavioural change approaches for the self-care of MAs,
drawing on the APEASE criteria. While patients and the
public were not involved in the design or conduct of the
review, patient views were central to the review and its
findings as they were the focus of analyses of service-user
views (reviews 1 and 2).

Results
How interventions were mapped: identification of BCTs and

At the broadest level, interventions were categorised into
three groups: health services (10 studies), education
(10 studies) and prescribing (3 studies) (Two interventions explored both prescribing and education). Details
of intervention characteristics are provided in online
supplementary table 1.
Evaluations of services for MAs
Evaluations of services for MAs were categorised into four
types: telephone triage (three studies), walk-in centre
(three studies), practice nursing (three studies) and
a paramedic service (one study). All of these services
included a number of interventions, such as patient examination and diagnosis, provision of advice and treatment,
issuing of prescriptions (which usually required a doctor’s
signature) and referral of the patient to GP/A&E, where
appropriate. With the exception of the community pharmacy interventions, reported elsewhere,14 there was little
evidence of effectiveness.
Evaluations of interventions for MAs
Among the educational interventions, five targeted the
management of MAs in general, two each for respiratory infections and back pain, and one on conjunctivitis. Nine BCTs were identified; these are detailed in
online supplementary table 2, together with illustrative
examples from the descriptions of the interventions and
the number of interventions that included them. BCTs
‘instruction on how to perform the behaviour’ and ‘information about health consequences’ (present in 10 studies
each) were most common, followed by ‘information

in a positive direction (one statistically significant); and
among the delayed versus control antibiotic comparisons
all three effect size estimates were in a positive direction
(two obtaining statistical significance).
Triangulation of findings using the TDF and COM-B system of
the BCW (step 2)
Table 3 shows the TDF domains, identified in the reviews
(denoted using the symbols ‘✓’ for present and ‘✗’ for
absent), mapped onto the COM-B model of behaviour
(denoted using the ‘#’ symbol). Where the ‘#’ is emboldened, this indicates that some of the interventions (identifed in review 3) targeted the focal domain; footnotes are
used to denote the BCTs.
Across the interview and survey reviews, 7 of the 14 TDF
domains were identified as relevant: Knowledge/Skills
(combined in reviews 1 and 2 because they overlapped
considerably); memory, attention and decision-making;
emotion; reinforcement; beliefs about consequences;
social influences and environmental context and
resources.
With the exception of two (infrequent) determinants
within the memory, attention and decision-making
domain (made decision alone and did not consider alternatives), they were successfully mapped onto the COM-B
system using the guidance provided.17
Three of these seven TDF domains were targeted by
existing interventions, including knowledge/skills, reinforcement and social influences. Among the education
interventions, while all targeted the combined knowledge/skills domain; only three incorporated elements
of skills training (‘problem solving’ and/or ‘behavioural
experiments’), the rest targeted only the (psychological)
knowledge aspect of the domain. Furthermore, only one
intervention targeted knowledge of self-care resources
(all focused on management of symptoms). Six education
interventions also targeted the reinforcement domain
(through the use of a health professional as a credible
source to support the intervention); three additionally
targeted the social influences domain (social support
provided by health professionals and vicarious learning);
and one targeted the goals domain using ‘action planning’ for exercise to help manage back pain.
The prescribing interventions (delayed and none) were
mapped onto the reinforcement domain and captured
the automatic motivation characteristic of habitual
behavioural responses to seek help from a GP or A&E
service when ill.
TDF domains (and subthemes), identified as determinants in the interviews and surveys, were categorised as
salient when they were identified in the interviews and
among a quarter or more of survey participants, and/or
had evidence of effectiveness in the evaluations of interventions. Determinants categorised as salient covered six
TDF domains:
►► Knowledge/skills (knowledge of services and management of symptoms) (As previously noted, despite
the mixed evidence across the evaluations, it seems

about antecedents’ of self-care behaviour (present in
eight studies); then ‘credible source’ (present in six
studies). The remaining BCTs were identified in one to
three studies each: ‘social support’ was identified in the
two interventions that focused on respiratory tract infections and ‘problem solving’ was additionally identified in
one of these, ‘problem solving’ and ‘behavioural experiments’ were present in the two back pain interventions
and ‘vicarious learning’ was in one study on the management of MAs in general. One of the education interventions for back pain included an exercise component that
involved the BCT ‘action planning’.
The most frequently occurring BCTs were mapped onto
the knowledge TDF domain. Previously, ‘instruction on
how to perform a behaviour’ has been mapped onto the
training TDF domain,17 however, knowledge was chosen
here, as the strategies (such as written guidance on how to
treat ailments) emphasised the acquisition of knowledge
rather than skills training. The less frequently identified
BCTs were mapped onto the following TDF domains:
reinforcement (‘credible source’), social influences
(‘social support’ and ‘vicarious consequences’), training
(‘problem solving’ and ‘behavioural experiments’) and
goals (‘action planning’). With the exception of ‘problem
solving’, which was not included in the expert consensus
exercise,8 these mappings were consistent.
Across educational intervention studies, there was
little evidence of beneficial effects across symptoms and
consultation outcomes, with almost equal numbers of
effect size estimates in a beneficial (10) and in an unfavourable (10) direction and only three (in a beneficial
direction) obtaining statistical significance. There were
no consistent patterns of intervention effects among those
studies that targeted either single or multiple BCTs/TDF
domains, suggesting that no single component, or combination thereof, was responsible for effectiveness. Despite
the mixed evidence across the reviews, we reasoned that
it seems likely that knowledge/skills in symptom management and healthcare services is a necessary, but insufficient, prerequisite to self-care, as has been shown in other
health behavioural domains.18
Among the prescribing interventions, two BCTs were
present (see online supplementary table 2): ‘behavioural
substitution’ (no antibiotic prescribing, identified in
three studies) and ‘non-specific incentive’ (delayed antibiotic prescribing, identified in two studies) which were
(both) mapped onto the reinforcement domain, as it
was assumed that they worked through weakening the
habitual association between minor symptoms and the
need to see a GP in the future for similar symptoms, as
assessed by subsequent consultation rates. The label of
‘non-specific incentive’ was relabelled ‘incentive’ and the
definition was modified slightly by replacing the word
‘reward’ with ‘prescription’: inform that a prescription
will be delivered if and only if there has been effort and/
or progress in performing the behaviour (self-care).
Among the no antibiotic versus immediate prescribing
comparisons, three of the five effect size estimates were

►► Reinforcement
(past
experience/habituated
behaviour).
►► Emotion (Anxiety about a potential health threat).
►► Beliefs about consequences (perceptions of illness
severity, perceptions of illness susceptibility, especially children seen as vulnerable, expected or actual
referral and perceived benefits of continuity of care).
►► Social influences (social support for self-care).
►► Environmental context and resources (geographical
immediacy, time taken to access care/information,
opening hours, lack of privacy for consultation, cost
of over-the-counter medications, limited roles related
to prescribing and capacity to physically examine)
Figure 2 shows the salient TDF domains mapped onto
the COM-B model of behaviour and indicates that capability (psychological and physical), opportunity (social
and environmental) and motivation (reflective and automatic) are all relevant features of self-care behaviour for
MAs.
BCTs and intervention strategies (step 3)
Only three of the six salient TDF domains were targeted
by existing interventions, and of these, only antibiotic prescribing strategies (none or delayed targeting
the reinforcement domain) showed some evidence of
Richardson M, et al. BMJ Open 2019;9:e024950. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024950

effectiveness, although in two or three studies only. Additional intervention strategies that could be used to target
the identified barriers to the self-care of MAs were, therefore, suggested.
Five intervention functions were considered most
appropriate for the self-care of MAs in the short term:
training, education (in conjunction with training),
persuasion, enablement and restriction. One additional
function (environmental restructuring) was identified as
appropriate for a more long-range approach to intervention. The remaining functions (incentivisation, coercion
and modelling) were considered impractical or unacceptable in this context (see online supplementary table 3).
Table 4 shows the salient TDF domains, mapped onto
the COM-B domains, systematically selected intervention functions, strategies and BCTs to deliver the relevant intervention functions. Illustrative strategies derived
from the analyses are briefly discussed for each COM-B
domain below.
Capability
Greater emphasis on knowledge of self-care resources
in addition to symptom management may enhance
people’s capability through improved access to the

an emphasis on skills training (such as self-monitoring
of the behaviour, behavioural rehearsal and demonstration of the behaviour) may improve physical capability

Motivation
In addition to prescribing interventions examined in
review 3 (delayed and none), other strategies may be
usefully implemented and tested. For example, automatic
motivation may be targeted through enabling serviceusers to identify anxiety as a trigger to visit GP/A&E
services and to initiate coping strategies to overcome such
urges. In terms of reflective motivation, targeting beliefs
about illness severity and susceptibility, especially among
parents of children, may be beneficial, for example, using
persuasion to strengthen beliefs that the opinions of
pharmacists and nurses are trustworthy.
Opportunity
For social opportunity, a suggested strategy was the
enablement of self-care through the provision of reassurance (eg, from a pharmacist) that self-care is appropriate;
for physical opportunity, restructuring of the environment was indicated, for example, by training more nurses
and pharmacists with full prescribing rights.
Stakeholder involvement
The stakeholders highlighted that a key NHS priority is
to flag the role of pharmacists in managing self-care, and
they informed us about strategies that had already been
implemented (such as providing private consultation
rooms in community pharmacies). Relevant strategies
that targeted the community pharmacy were, therefore,
emphasised. This is consistent with the findings that pharmacy care for MAs is the only service with some evidence
of effectiveness.14

Discussion
Summary of the principal methodological findings
Framing the determinants of self-care using the TDF
and BCW, permitted a synthesis of the findings of three
reviews with different types of evidence. The TDF/
BCW approach also helped identify interventions that
targeted the likely determinants of self-care behaviour.
This enables policy-makers and intervention designers
to optimise interventions, by ensuring that they target
these likely determinants. Although this method does
not guarantee success, it does increase the likelihood
of any intervention being successful as it will target the
determinants with an intervention that is known to be
effective for similar scenarios. Synthesising research in
this way effectively creates specific recommendations
that can be implemented in various local systems, in ways
that build up the evidence of what works, for whom, and
under which circumstances. This is an important development distinguishing it from other approaches, such as
14

triangulation, which is limited to the cross-referencing of
study findings.
While the BCW provides a systematic and theory-guided
method for identifying the types of interventions that are
expected to be effective, it does not provide a detailed
blueprint for the design of specific behavioural change
interventions, as acknowledged by its authors.17 For
example, we chose to map the BCT (identified in review
3) ‘instruction on how to perform the behaviour’ onto
the TDF Knowledge domain (rather than skills training,
as mapped previously) because the content of the interventions emphasised a didactic approach to instruction.
Notably, however, the knowledge and skills domains were
combined in the interview and survey data, due to considerable overlap. Users, therefore, should expect to apply
the framework with some flexibility, as acknowledged by
its creators. For example, combining or mapping BCTs
onto multiple domains, where there is considerable
overlap; adding domains or BCTs, where the model does
not account for them; and documenting any such amendments to support the ongoing development and refinement of this method.
As with the TDF, the application of the BCW requires
subjectivity and inference. Identifying the intervention
functions, and associated BCTs, was fairly straight-forward. However, defining the content of the strategies,
while based on the salient determinants in the overarching synthesis, required some creativity. Stakeholder
involvement was, therefore, essential for clarifying the
feasibility and acceptability of the systematic review and
theory-based strategies.
The syntheses required considerable time which was
supported by an iterative rather than sequential approach
to analyses. In applying this method, the researcher
should, therefore, expect to revisit and revise their coding
and understanding of the topic several times, as knowledge evolves and emerges throughout the process of
synthesis.
Summary of the principal substantive findings
For people with MAss, mapping the salient TDF domains
onto the COM-B system of behavioural change showed
that all aspects were relevant for promoting self-care
behaviour: people’s capability to self-care, their opportunity to self-care and their motivation to self-care. Few
of the existing interventions directly targeted these
determinants. Potentially relevant intervention strategies that target the salient TDF domains were suggested
and discussed with key stakeholders. The existing knowledge-based interventions (evaluated in review 3) did not
typically target knowledge of healthcare services (such
as community pharmacy) nor skills to support self-care.
Given the stakeholders advice to place emphasis on the
role of pharmacists in managing self-care, this seems
especially important. Health providers, such as pharmacists, may be able to help service-users manage their
anxiety (identified as a problem among a high proportion of survey participants). However, service-users

particularly (over and above didactic knowledge acquisition or theory), for example, through using a daily
symptom diary, when sick, to improve skills in the recognition and treatment of MAs and the identification of
danger signs and symptoms.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other reviews
With the exception of community pharmacy,14 no
previous systematic reviews were identified in the topic
area. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the
TDF/BCW approach has been used to bring together
evidence using mixed methods within a series of systematic reviews. Limitations include the limited number and
diversity of studies in each review; the limited evidence
from evaluations (review 3) of interventions targeting the
specific determinants identified in the interviews (review
1) and surveys (review 2); and possible biases in the
primary reviews, which were conducted by ourselves. The
threshold of 25%, used to determine the relevance of
determinants in the survey data, was arbitrary. The BCT
coding was hampered by the quality of the intervention
descriptions, and it was not possible to statistically analyse
the individual effectiveness of BCTs or of different combinations. Reducing unnecessary attendance at GP/A&E
services involves multiple behaviours. We were unable,
therefore, to map the behavioural change theory to
specific behaviour, as has been done elsewhere. Without
longitudinal modelling studies or intervention designs,
it is difficult to establish which determinants are most
important and whether the links between theoretical
assessment and BCTs are valid. Nonetheless, consistency
across multiple sources provides more confidence in the
findings than each method alone. Criteria to assess the
quality of outputs when using this type of synthesis would
be beneficial, but to our knowledge, are not currently
available. Both of the interview and survey reviews were
already synthesised using the TDF, whether this approach
to synthesis would work if other models had been used is
unclear.
Future research
Given the inferential and speculative aspects of the analysis, and the infancy of the BCW approach, further empirical work is required to check whether the links between
theoretical assessments and BCTs are valid. Furthermore,
while exploring the inter-relationships between the TDF
domains was outside the scope of the review, greater
consideration of the inter-relationships between theoretical domains may be warranted. For example, the recursive relationship between environmental and resource
factors, and individual perceptions and behaviour, in the
decision to self-care.
Conclusions
Although the TDF and BCW are being applied more
frequently in public health research, to our knowledge,
Richardson M, et al. BMJ Open 2019;9:e024950. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024950

this is the first time that the TDF has been used to bring
together quantitative and qualitative evidence in an overarching synthesis, within a series of systematic reviews.
The use of the TDF and BCW provided a clear structure,
and permitted comparison across reviews and the application of pre-existing mechanistic knowledge within a
systematic review context. It also permitted the identification of the salient determinants of the self-care for MAs
and potential intervention strategies that target these.
The theoretical scaffold provides a means to accumulate
the evidence and could potentially be used to understand
behaviour in similar contexts.

ABSTRACT
Background
The pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied. However, there are common reasons why they might help
people to stop smoking tobacco: nicotine withdrawal can produce short-term low mood that antidepressants may relieve; and some
antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction.
Objectives
To assess the evidence for the efficacy, harms, and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long-term tobacco
smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, most recently on 29 April 2022.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people who smoked, comparing antidepressant medications with placebo or no
pharmacological treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used differently. We excluded trials with fewer than
six months of follow-up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow-up length for our analyses of harms.
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods.
Our primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months' follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of
abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Our secondary outcomes were harms and tolerance
outcomes, including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), psychiatric AEs, seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by
suicide, all-cause mortality, and trial dropouts due to treatment. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate.
Main results
We included a total of 124 studies (48,832 participants) in this review, with 10 new studies added to this update version. Most studies
recruited adults from the community or from smoking cessation clinics; four studies focused on adolescents (with participants between
12 and 21 years old). We judged 34 studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk of
bias did not change clinical interpretation of the results.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

There was high-certainty evidence that bupropion increased smoking cessation rates when compared to placebo or no pharmacological
treatment (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.72; I2 = 16%; 50 studies, 18,577 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that a
combination of bupropion and varenicline may have resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I2 =
15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence to establish whether a combination of bupropion and nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; I2 = 43%; 15 studies, 4117 participants;
low-certainty evidence).
There was moderate-certainty evidence that participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs than those taking placebo or
no pharmacological treatment. However, results were imprecise and the CI also encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I2
= 0%; 23 studies, 10,958 participants). Results were also imprecise when comparing SAEs between people randomised to a combination of
bupropion and NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.89; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 657 participants) and randomised to bupropion plus
varenicline versus varenicline alone (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.42; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 1268 participants). In both cases, we judged evidence
to be of low certainty.
There was high-certainty evidence that bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to AEs than placebo or no pharmacological treatment
(RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.65; I2 = 2%; 25 studies, 12,346 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence that bupropion combined
with NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.92; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 737 participants) or bupropion combined with varenicline
versus varenicline alone (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.45; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1230 participants) had an impact on the number of dropouts due
to treatment. In both cases, imprecision was substantial (we judged the evidence to be of low certainty for both comparisons).
Bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 7564 participants), and
to combination NRT (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; I2 = 0%; 2 studies; 720 participants). However, there was no clear evidence of a difference
in efficacy between bupropion and single-form NRT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I2 = 0%; 10 studies, 7613 participants). We also found
evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I2 = 16%; 6 studies, 975
participants), and some evidence that bupropion resulted in superior quit rates to nortriptyline (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I2 = 0%; 3
studies, 417 participants), although this result was subject to imprecision.
Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for
people with current or previous depression.
Authors' conclusions
There is high-certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long-term smoking cessation. However, bupropion may increase SAEs (moderatecertainty evidence when compared to placebo/no pharmacological treatment). There is high-certainty evidence that people taking
bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with people receiving placebo or no pharmacological treatment.
Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo, although bupropion may be more effective.
Evidence also suggests that bupropion may be as successful as single-form NRT in helping people to quit smoking, but less effective than
combination NRT and varenicline. In most cases, a paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding harms and tolerability.
Further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing
no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over other licensed smoking cessation treatments; namely, NRT and
varenicline. However, it is important that future studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation measure and report on harms and
tolerability.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
Do medicines for depression help people to quit smoking?
What are antidepressants?
Antidepressants are medicines and supplements used to treat depression. Some have also been tested to see whether they can help people
to stop smoking. Two of these treatments – bupropion (sometimes called Zyban) and nortriptyline – are sometimes given to help people
quit smoking.
Why we did this Cochrane Review
Smoking tobacco is extremely bad for people’s health. For people who smoke, quitting is the best thing they can do to improve their health.
Many people find it difficult to quit smoking. We wanted to find out whether using antidepressants helps people to stop smoking (for six
months or longer), and what potential harms might come from using these medicines.
We were interested in finding out:
- how many people stopped smoking for at least six months; and

- how many people had unwanted effects.
What did we do?
We searched for studies that looked at the use of antidepressants to help people quit smoking.
We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually
gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of treatment. We included studies of any length when looking at evidence of harms, but
studies needed to be at least six months long when assessing whether people had managed to quit smoking.
What we found
This review includes 124 studies, including 48,832 participants, looking at how helpful and safe different antidepressants are when used
to quit smoking. Most studies were conducted in adults who smoked tobacco, with and without a history of mental illness. Four studies
recruited young people aged 12 to 21 years. Most participants were motivated to quit smoking.
What are the results of our review?
Compared to not using any medication, using the antidepressant bupropion makes it 49% to 72% more likely that a person will successfully
stop smoking, which is equal to six to eight more people successfully quitting for six months or more for every one hundred people who
try to quit. There is evidence that people who use the antidepressant nortriptyline to quit smoking also improve their chances of success
(48% to 178% more likely).
Bupropion may increase serious unwanted effects (such as death, hospitalisation, or life-threatening events). Unwanted effects may
increase the chance that people stop using the medicine. There is not enough information to draw clear conclusions about the harms of
nortriptyline for stopping smoking.
The evidence suggests that taking bupropion at the same time as other stop-smoking medicines – varenicline (a drug sometimes known
as Champix or Chantix which is not an antidepressant) and combination nicotine replacement therapy (a patch plus another form) – may
make people more likely to quit smoking than if they use nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline on their own. However, further
evidence may change our findings. The evidence does not suggest a benefit of using bupropion at the same time as a single form of nicotine
replacement therapy; for example, a patch, gum, or lozenge alone. People may be more likely to quit smoking when using bupropion
compared with nortriptyline, but more likely to quit when using varenicline than bupropion.
How reliable are these results?
There is high-certainty evidence that bupropion helps people to quit smoking, meaning further research is very unlikely to change this
conclusion. However, there is also high-certainty evidence to suggest that people using bupropion are more likely to stop taking the
medicine because of unpleasant effects than those taking a pill without medication (a placebo) or no medication. The certainty of the
evidence was moderate or low for the other key questions we looked at. This means that the findings of those questions may change when
more research is carried out. In most cases, this was because there were not enough studies or studies were too small.
How up to date is this evidence?
This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.
Key messages
- Bupropion can help people to quit smoking but may make people more likely to experience serious unwanted effects that could result
in people stopping taking it or having to go to the hospital.
- Nortriptyline also appears to help people to quit smoking, but bupropion may be more effective.
- Bupropion may be as helpful as a single form of nicotine replacement therapy in helping people to quit smoking, but less so than
combination nicotine replacement therapy (that is, a patch plus another form) and varenicline.

BACKGROUND

How the intervention might work

Description of the condition

Multiple observations have provided a rationale for studying the
effects of antidepressant medications for smoking cessation: a
history of depression is found more frequently amongst people
who smoke than people who do not smoke; nicotine may
have antidepressant effects; and antidepressants influence the
neurotransmitters and receptors involved in nicotine addiction
(Benowitz 2000; Kotlyar 2001). Although evidence suggests that
cessation is likely to improve rather than worsen mood in the
long-term (Taylor 2021), smoking abstinence does cause short-term
withdrawal symptoms, including depressed mood and irritability,
which may prompt relapse to smoking (Hughes 2007).

Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable illness
and death worldwide, accounting for over seven million deaths
annually (GBD 2019 TC). Extrapolation based on current smoking
trends suggests that, without widespread quitting, approximately
4050 million tobacco-related deaths will occur between 2000 and
2050, mostly amongst current smokers (Jha 2011). Most smokers
would like to stop (CDC 2017); however, quitting tobacco use
is difficult. This is because users develop both a psychological
and physiological dependence on smoking. The physiological
dependence is caused by a component of tobacco, called nicotine
(McNeill 2017).

Description of the intervention
Whilst antidepressant medications are primarily used for the
treatment of depression and disorders of negative affect,
they have also been used to help individuals stop smoking.
They offer an alternative to other first-line smoking cessation
pharmacotherapies (first treatments provided for tobacco
addiction), such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and
nicotine agonists, such as varenicline.
The following medications and substances, regarded as having
antidepressant properties, have been investigated for their effect
on smoking cessation in at least one study.
• Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): doxepin, imipramine, and
nortriptyline
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): moclobemide,
selegiline, lazabemide, and EVT302
• Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): fluoxetine,
paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and zimelidine
• Atypical antidepressants: bupropion, tryptophan, and
venlafaxine
• Extracts of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum)
• Dietary supplement: S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)
Of the antidepressant medications indicated for smoking
cessation, the most commonly used is bupropion. It has both
dopaminergic and adrenergic actions, and appears to be an
antagonist at the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (Fryer 1999). It
has been licensed as a prescription medicine for smoking cessation
in many countries. The usual dose for smoking cessation is 150
mg once a day for three days, increasing to 150 mg twice a day
continued for seven to 12 weeks. Quit attempts are generally
initiated one week after starting pharmacotherapy.
Following bupropion, the second most commonly tested
medication for smoking cessation is the TCA, nortriptyline. It
enhances noradrenergic and serotonergic activity by blocking
reuptake of these neurotransmitters (Benowitz 2000). It is licensed
for smoking cessation in New Zealand. The recommended regimen
is 10 to 28 days of titration before the quit attempt, followed by a
12-week dose of 75 mg to 100 mg daily (Cahill 2013).
No other antidepressants are currently licensed for use as smoking
cessation treatment, although others have been tested for possible
use.

The diverse pharmacological targets of antidepressants means
their mechanisms of action are varied. Evidence suggests
bupropion may aid smoking cessation by blocking nicotine effects,
relieving withdrawal (Cryan 2003; West 2008), and reducing
depressed mood (Lerman 2002). Monoamine oxidase-A (MOA-A)
inhibitors may aid smoking cessation by substituting the ability
of smoking to act as an MOA inhibitor (Lewis 2007). It has been
hypothesised that SSRIs might be helpful because they increase
serotonin, which is also associated with improving negative affect
(Benowitz 2000). The mechanisms of other antidepressants for
smoking cessation remain unstudied.
Although there is an evident relationship between alleviating
negative affect and antidepressant pharmacology, it is unclear
whether antidepressants work mostly due to reducing negative
affect, reducing urges to smoke or withdrawal symptoms, or by
acting as nicotine blockers.

Why it is important to do this review
This is the fifth update of a review first published in 2003.
It is a linked to a wider project updating all evidence
on licenced pharmacotherapies and e-cigarettes for smoking
cessation (Lindson 2022). It was deemed appropriate to update this
review as a useful output of this wider project for the following
reasons. The ongoing impact of smoking on global morbidity
and mortality necessitates effective and safe treatments to aid
smoking cessation. Emerging evidence assessing antidepressants
as smoking cessation treatments has the potential to change or
strengthen many of our conclusions regarding the efficacy, harms,
and tolerability of the antidepressants currently being used to
help people quit smoking (bupropion and nortriptyline). Further
evidence on harms may help to clarify the potential interaction
between bupropion and seizures, as well as psychiatric adverse
events. Multiple trials and observational studies have previously
associated bupropion with increasing the risk of medically
important adverse events, including seizures, anxiety, depression,
and insomnia (Aubin 2012). New evidence may also help us to
directly compare the harms and efficacy of antidepressants with
other first-line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, providing a
further aid to decision making when helping people to quit tobacco
smoking.

OBJECTIVES
To assess the evidence for the efficacy, harms, and tolerability of
medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long-term
tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes.

findings, hypersensitivity, and progression or worsening of
underlying disease);
◦ number of people experiencing psychiatric AEs (e.g. adverse
events relating to mental health);
◦ number of people experiencing serious adverse events
(SAEs); that is, events that result in death, are lifethreatening (immediate risk of death), require inpatient
hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation,
result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (e.g.
seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by suicide, allcause mortality).

METHODS
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs.
We did not include cross-over studies as this type of randomised
study does not allow assessment of the medium- to long-term
effects of smoking cessation medications on abstinence.
Types of participants
We included people of any age who smoked tobacco, with or
without a history of mental illness. We did not include pregnant
women, as this specific subpopulation is covered in a separate
Cochrane Review (Claire 2020).
Types of interventions
We included trials studying pharmacotherapies with
antidepressant properties for smoking cessation. We included
trials assessing different doses, durations, and schedules of
antidepressants.
We excluded trials where an additional, uncontrolled, nonantidepressant intervention component was used in only one of
the trial arms. This is because the confounding effects of this
intervention would have made it difficult to determine whether
any change in outcome was related to the antidepressant or the
confounding intervention component. Additionally, we excluded
trials investigating antidepressant use for smoking harm reduction
or relapse prevention, as they are covered elsewhere (LindsonHawley 2016 and Livingstone-Banks 2019, respectively).
Comparators
The following comparators were eligible for assessing harms,
efficacy, and tolerability: placebo, no pharmacological treatment,
alternative therapeutic control, or different dosages/treatment
regimes of the same antidepressant.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Efficacy, measured as smoking cessation
For this outcome, we only included studies that set out to report
smoking cessation rates at least six months after baseline, in line
with the standard methods of Cochrane Tobacco Addiction. Where
cessation was assessed at multiple intervals, we reported only
the longest follow-up data. Additionally, where studies assessed
multiple definitions of abstinence, we reported the strictest of
these definitions (e.g. continuous/prolonged abstinence over point
prevalence abstinence). We also reported biochemical validation of
abstinence over self-reported abstinence (but it was not necessary
for abstinence to have been biochemically validated for a study to
be included).

We also recorded the following SAEs specifically, as these have
previously been associated with the use of antidepressants for
smoking cessation.
•
•
•
•
•
•

Number of people experiencing seizures
Number of people experiencing overdoses
Number of people experiencing suicide attempts
Number of people experiencing death by suicide
Number of people experiencing all-cause mortality
Tolerability, measured as the number of participants who
dropped out of the trial due to adverse events

For all harm and tolerability outcomes, we considered studies with
follow-up of any length.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We identified studies from the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction
Specialised Register. At the time of the updated search (29 April
2022), the Register included reports of trials indexed in: the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue
3, 2022; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 2022 April 05; Embase
(via OVID) to 2022 week 14; PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 2022
April 04 – all from inception. See the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction
website for full search strategies and a list of other resources
searched to populate the Register. We searched the Register for
reports of studies evaluating bupropion, nortriptyline, or any other
pharmacotherapy classified as having an antidepressant effect.
Searches for the Register are not restricted by date, language, or
format of publication. Search terms included relevant individual
drug names or antidepressant* or antidepressive*. See Appendix
1 for the Register search strategy.
Searching other resources
Our searches of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction
Specialised Register also covered records in ClinicalTrials.gov
(ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), as these are indexed in
CENTRAL.

eligibility. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion
with a third review author. For conference abstracts or trial
registry entries where the record contained insufficient evidence
for us to determine the eligibility, we attempted to contact study
investigators to obtain any additional data needed to make a final
decision. We recorded all screening decisions made and presented
the flow of studies and references through the reviewing process
using a PRISMA flow diagram (Moher 2009).
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (for this update EK, AH) independently
extracted the following study data and compared the findings. We
resolved any discrepancies by mutual consent.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed included studies for risks of selection bias (method
of random sequence generation and allocation concealment),
bias due to an absence of blinding (taking into account both
performance and detection bias in a single domain), attrition
bias (levels and reporting of loss to follow-up), and any other
threats to study validity, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool
(Higgins 2011). For each new study in this update, two review
authors (EK, AH) independently assessed each study for each
domain, in accordance with risk of bias guidance developed by
Cochrane Tobacco Addiction to assess smoking cessation studies.
We resolved any disagreements about the assessment through
discussion with a third review author.
We considered studies at high risk of performance and detection
bias where there was no blinding of participants or personnel
or where there was evidence of unblinding; at unclear risk if
insufficient information was available with which to judge; and at
low risk if the study reported blinding of participants and personnel
in detail and there was no evidence of unblinding. We considered
studies to be at low risk of attrition bias where over half of the
participants were followed up at the longest follow-up and where
numbers followed up were similar across arms (difference < 20%).

Measures of treatment effect
Smoking cessation
We calculated cessation rates for all studies that reported cessation
at least six months following baseline. For each study, we used the
strictest available criteria to define cessation, as described above.
Where data were available, we expressed cessation as a risk ratio
(RR) for each study. We calculated this as follows: (quitters in
treatment group/total randomised to treatment group)/(quitters in
control group/total randomised to control group), alongside 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). A RR greater than 1 indicates increased
likelihood of quitting in the intervention group than in the control
condition.
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)
We calculated AE rates for all studies that reported adequate
data, regardless of study length. Where numerical data were
available, we expressed AE and tolerability data as RRs (95% CI). We
calculated this as follows: (number of participants reporting (S)AEs
in treatment group/total randomised to treatment group)/(number
of participants reporting (S)AEs in control group/total randomised
to control group). A RR greater than 1 indicates an increased
likelihood of experiencing an AE or SAE in the intervention group
than in the control condition.
In addition to overall AEs and overall SAEs, we calculated RRs (95%
CI) for the following harm and tolerability outcomes, where data
were available.

Unit of analysis issues
We found three cluster-RCTs eligible for inclusion: Hilberink
2010, Kumar 2020, and Siddiqi 2013. Siddiqi 2013 was not pooled in
any meta-analysis due to substantial heterogeneity of programme
effects across clusters. In consultation with a statistician (TF),
clustering effects in Hilberink 2010 were deemed to be negligible
and therefore no adjustment was made, and results from Kumar
2020 were adjusted for clustering using a reported design effect.
Dealing with missing data
As far as possible, we used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis,
with people who dropped out or were lost to follow-up treated
as continuing smokers. Where participants appeared to have been
randomised, but were not included in the data presented by the
authors (and we were unable to obtain these), we noted this in
the study description (see Characteristics of included studies). We
extracted numbers lost to follow-up from study reports and used
these to assess the risk of attrition bias.

Assessment of heterogeneity
Before pooling studies, we considered both methodological and
clinical variance between studies. Where pooling was deemed
appropriate, we investigated statistical heterogeneity using the I2
statistic (Higgins 2003). This describes the percentage variability in
effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling
error (chance).
Assessment of reporting biases
For three comparisons (bupropion versus placebo/no
pharmacological treatment; bupropion and NRT versus NRT alone;
bupropion and varenicline versus varenicline alone), we generated
funnel plots where the following outcomes had 10 or more studies
contributing to an analysis of these outcomes: smoking cessation;
SAEs; dropouts due to treatment (i.e. outcomes included in our
summary of findings tables). We interpreted these plots to report
on potential publication bias, as advised by the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).
We therefore generated the following funnel plots:
• bupropion versus placebo/no pharmacological treatment smoking cessation;
• bupropion versus placebo/no pharmacological treatment serious adverse events;
• bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus NRT
alone - smoking cessation.
Data synthesis
For each type of medication and comparison where more than
one eligible trial was identified, we performed separate metaanalyses of cessation and harms outcomes using Mantel-Haenszel
fixed-effect methods. We pooled RRs and 95% CIs from individual
study estimates to estimate pooled RRs (95% CIs). Where studies
contributed more than one intervention arm to a pooled analysis,
we split the control arm to avoid double-counting.
As in the previous update of this review (Howes 2020), we also
carried out post hoc, exploratory analyses combining the following
comparisons when evaluating AEs, psychiatric AEs, SAEs, and
dropouts due to adverse effects.
• Bupropion compared to placebo/no pharmacological treatment
• Bupropion plus NRT compared to NRT alone
• Bupropion plus varenicline compared to varenicline alone
The rationale for this was that these studies all tested the additional
effect of bupropion, and there is no reason to expect an interaction
for harm and tolerability outcomes. We subgrouped studies by their
comparison type, though we acknowledge that these subgroups
may currently be underpowered to detect differences between
groups.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where possible, we separated participant data into the
following subgroups within comparisons, to determine whether
antidepressants had differential effects on the relevant population
or intervention groups.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Split by level of behavioural support: multisession group
support versus multisession individual counselling versus lowintensity support versus not specified. To be identified as low
intensity, support had to be regarded as part of the provision
of routine care; that is, time spent with smoker (including
assessment for the trial) was less than 30 minutes at the initial
consultation, with no more than two further assessment and
reinforcement visits.
Where reported, we also extracted data from analyses evaluating
a potential interaction between current depression or past history
of depression and quit rates. We relied upon the definition
of depression used by study authors, which included both
formal diagnoses and scores on validated depression scales. This
interaction is investigated in more detail in Van der Meer 2013.
Sensitivity analysis
We carried out the following sensitivity analyses.
• We excluded studies from meta-analyses that we judged to be at
high risk of bias for any of the assessed bias domains. We judged
whether this exclusion notably altered the pooled RRs (95% CI).
• We excluded studies from meta-analyses with industry support.
We did this in two stages: 1) we excluded studies that were
funded by the pharmaceutical industry; 2) we excluded studies
that were funded by the pharmaceutical industry or where the
study medication was provided by the pharmaceutical industry.
We judged whether these exclusions notably altered the pooled
RRs (95% CI). There is evidence that Industry funding support
may influence the findings of studies investigating the effects of
smoking cessation medications (Etter 2007; Klemperer 2020).
Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence
We created summary of findings tables using standard Cochrane
methodology (Higgins 2019), for the following comparisons, which
we judged to be most clinically relevant.
• Bupropion compared to placebo/no pharmacological treatment
• Bupropion plus NRT compared to NRT alone
• Bupropion plus varenicline compared to varenicline alone
We judged these comparisons to be of most relevance because
bupropion is currently the only antidepressant used as a first-line
pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation worldwide.
Following standard Cochrane methodology (Higgins 2019), we
used GRADEpro GDT software and the five GRADE considerations
(risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and
publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence
for three outcomes: smoking cessation, SAEs, and dropouts due to
adverse events of the treatment, and to draw conclusions about
the certainty of the evidence (Schünemann 2013). We chose these
outcomes as they are important factors to consider regarding
pharmaceutical efficacy, harms, and tolerability, and are therefore
useful to both clinicians and patients when deciding whether to
provide or use a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy.

Results of the search
The most recent literature search for this update generated 116
records. After we removed duplicates, 105 records remained for
title and abstract screening. We ruled out 84 irrelevant records
at this stage, leaving 21 records for full-text screening. At this
stage, we identified four new studies for inclusion (Abdelghany
2022; Kumar 2020; Qin 2021; Zhang 2022) and two new ongoing

studies (NCT04604509; NCT05205811). We also identified two new
references linked to two studies previously included in the review,
and six new included studies through further consideration of
studies previously excluded from the previous version of this review
(Howes 2020). In most cases, these studies had been excluded in
the first instance due to the unavailability of key data (Evins 2008;
Hilberink 2010; Hoch 2006; Rovina 2003; Schepis 2006; Swanson
2003). See Figure 1 for full details of record/study flow information
for the most recent updated search. Of note, we also discovered
that two records previously included in this review as two separate
studies were reporting on one study (Weinberger 2008). Therefore,
these records have now been merged into a single study. Data from
this study had not previously been included in meta-analyses and
so did not pose a threat to the integrity of previous analyses.

Included studies
In total, we included 10 new studies at this update (four newly
identified from this 2022 search: Abdelghany 2022; Kumar 2020;
Qin 2021; Zhang 2022; six were previously excluded in the earlier
review version (Howes 2020) and have now been reassessed and
included: Evins 2008; Hilberink 2010; Hoch 2006; Rovina 2003;
Schepis 2006; Swanson 2003), yielding a total of 124 included
trials, including 48,832 participants. The new included studies all
investigated the use of bupropion. Further details of these newly
included, as well as previously included, studies are recorded in
the Characteristics of included studies tables.
Bupropion
Overall, we included 99 studies of bupropion. The majority of
trials were conducted in North America, but we also included
studies from Egypt (Abdelghany 2022), Australia (Myles 2004);
Brazil (Haggsträm 2006); China (Sheng 2013; Qin 2021); Europe
(Aubin 2004; Dalsgarð 2004; Fossati 2007; Górecka 2003; Rovina
2009; Stapleton 2013; Wagena 2005; Wittchen 2011; Zellweger
2005); India (Kumar 2020; Johns 2017; Singh 2010); Israel
(Planer 2011); New Zealand (Holt 2005); Pakistan (Siddiqi 2013);
Taiwan (NCT00495352); and Turkey (Benli 2017; Uyar 2007; Zincir
2013). Three studies were carried out across multiple continents
(Anthenelli 2016; Tonnesen 2003; Tonstad 2003).
A number of studies specifically recruited cohorts of participants
with health conditions, including:
• alcohol use disorder (Grant 2007; Hays 2009; Karam-Hage 2011);
• bipolar disorder (Weinberger 2008);

• cancer (Schnoll 2010);
• cardiovascular disease (Eisenberg 2013; Planer 2011; Rigotti
2006; Tonstad 2003);
• chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Górecka 2003; Tashkin
2001; Wagena 2005; Hilberink 2010);
• mild depression (Moreno-Coutino 2015);
• psychiatric conditions (Anthenelli 2016; Evins 2008);
• schizophrenia (Evins 2001; Evins 2005; Evins 2007; Fatemi 2013;
George 2002; George 2008; NCT00495352; Weiner 2012);
• post-traumatic stress disorder (Hertzberg 2001);
• tuberculosis or suspected tuberculosis (Siddiqi 2013; Kumar
2020).
Three of the studies in people with cardiovascular disease, and one
other, enrolled hospital inpatients (Eisenberg 2013; Planer 2011;
Rigotti 2006; Simon 2009).

• people who had previously failed to quit smoking using
bupropion (Gonzales 2001; Selby 2003);
• people who had recently failed to quit using NRT (Hurt 2003;
Rose 2013; Rose 2014);
• sailors (Swanson 2003).
More than half the bupropion studies followed participants for at
least 12 months from the start of treatment or the target quit day.
Thirty-four studies followed up participants for six months. The
duration of follow-up was under six months for 14 of the included
studies, was of unknown duration for seven studies, and one study
measured number of days abstinent rather than numbers abstinent
at a particular time point (Perkins 2013). We included these studies
as they measured harms and do not contribute efficacy data to our
meta-analyses. Schepis 2006 planned to do a six-month analysis,
but no data were available for this time point. Likewise, Elsasser
2002 planned to do a 52-week study, but the available abstract
only includes data up to the 12-week follow-up. Neither study
contributes to our efficacy analyses.
In those studies which met or exceeded the six-month followup threshold, the majority reported an outcome of sustained
(prolonged) abstinence. However, in 32 studies, only point
prevalence rates were given, or the definition of abstinence was
unclear.
Sixty-two trials evaluated bupropion for smoking cessation as
a single pharmacotherapy versus placebo/no pharmacological
treatment, and three studies compared different doses
of bupropion (Hurt 1997; Muramoto 2007; Swan 2003).
Both Muramoto 2007 and Swan 2003 compared a 150 mg dose per
day with a 300 mg dose per day, whereas Hurt 1997 looked at 100
mg per day versus 150 mg per day versus 300 mg per day. One study
looked at different durations of bupropion (Rovina 2003), at seven
and 19 weeks. We pooled studies in which bupropion was used
in combination with another pharmacotherapy or versus another
pharmacotherapy in separate comparisons.
Nortriptyline
We included 10 studies of the tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline,
in this review. Hall and colleagues conducted three trials (Hall 1998;
Hall 2002; Hall 2004), and Prochazka and colleagues conducted two
(Prochazka 1998; Prochazka 2004), with all these trials conducted
in the USA. One study was conducted in Australia (Richmond
2013), two in Brazil (Da Costa 2002; Haggsträm 2006), one in the
Netherlands (Wagena 2005), and one in the UK (Aveyard 2008).
Richmond 2013 was the only study to be conducted in a specialist
population, recruiting male prisoners who had been incarcerated
for at least one month and had at least six months remaining of their
sentences.
All studies were placebo-controlled. They used nortriptyline doses
of 75 mg/day to 100 mg/day or titrated doses to serum levels
recommended for depression during the week prior to the quit
date.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

follow-up of six months. The three studies by Hall and colleagues
used factorial designs to test nortriptyline versus placebo crossed
with different intensities of behavioural support (Hall 1998; Hall
2002; Hall 2004). Conversely, the remaining studies provided a set
amount of behavioural support to all participants, ranging from
brief behavioural counselling to repeated group and individual
sessions. Six studies tested nortriptyline as a monotherapy, and
four studies tested nortriptyline as an adjunct to NRT.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
Fluoxetine

We have included seven studies of fluoxetine in this review, with
two of these studies identified for inclusion in the current update
(Minami 2014; NCT00578669).
Most of these trials took place in the USA (Brown 2014; Minami 2014;
NCT00578669; Niaura 2002; Saules 2004; Spring 2007), with one
in Iceland (Blondal 1999). Participants were recruited from clinics
(Blondal 1999; Brown 2014; Niaura 2002; Saules 2004; Spring 2007),
the community (Minami 2014), or through an unknown recruitment
method (NCT00578669).
Brown 2014 was the only study to be conducted in a
specialist population, recruiting smokers with elevated depressive
symptoms.
Six of these studies conducted follow-up to at least six months for
cessation outcomes. Minami 2014 had a follow-up duration of fewer
than six months, so we only evaluated adverse events data for this
study.
Four studies used varying doses of fluoxetine as a single
pharmacotherapy: Niaura 2002 compared a 30 mg daily dose, a
60 mg daily dose, or placebo for 10 weeks; Spring 2007 used 60
mg or placebo for 12 weeks; NCT00578669 compared 20 mg daily
for eight weeks preceding and following the target quit date to
placebo. Minami 2014 also compared fluoxetine as a monotherapy
(20 mg daily for eight weeks prior to and following the target quit
date) to placebo only.
The remaining three trials investigated fluoxetine as an adjunct
to NRT, and used similar doses of fluoxetine: Blondal 1999 used
20 mg/day or placebo for three months as an adjunct to nicotine
inhaler; Saules 2004 used 20 mg/day or 40 mg/day or placebo for 10
weeks as an adjunct to nicotine patch; and Brown 2014 compared
10 weeks of 20 mg daily fluoxetine, 16 weeks of 20 mg daily
fluoxetine, or no additional treatment in participants using a
nicotine patch for eight weeks.
Paroxetine

One trial assessed paroxetine (20 mg, 40 mg, or placebo) for
nine weeks as an adjunct to nicotine patch (Killen 2000). It
was conducted in the USA, with participants recruited from the
community. It measured smoking cessation (defined as seven-day
point prevalence abstinence) at six months' follow-up.
Sertraline

Treatment duration ranged from 12 to 14 weeks. Nearly all
studies used a definition of cessation based on a sustained
period of abstinence. Aveyard 2008, Hall 1998, Hall 2002, Hall
2004, and Richmond 2013 reported outcomes at 12 months of
follow-up or longer, and the other six studies had a maximum

One trial with six months' follow-up assessed sertraline (200 mg/
day) for 11 weeks versus placebo in conjunction with six individual
counselling sessions. All participants had a past history of major
depression (Covey 2002).

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
Moclobemide

Moclobemide was tested for smoking cessation in one placebocontrolled trial, carried out in France (Berlin 1995). Participants
were recruited using advertisements in community healthcare
settings. Treatment with 400 mg/day began one week before quit
day and continued for two months, reducing to 200 mg/day for
a further month. No behavioural counselling was provided. Final
follow-up for smoking cessation (defined as prolonged abstinence)
was at 12 months.
Selegiline

We included five long-term trials testing selegiline in this review.
They were carried out in the USA (George 2003; Kahn 2012; Killen
2010; Weinberger 2010), and Israel (Biberman 2003). All studies
recruited participants from the community.
Almost all studies delivered selegiline as a monotherapy compared
to placebo, excluding Biberman 2003, which used a combination of
selegiline and nicotine patch compared to placebo.
Three studies used 10 mg/day of oral treatment (Biberman 2003;
George 2003; Weinberger 2010), and two used 6 mg/day of patch
treatment (Kahn 2012; Killen 2010). The nicotine patches also used
in Biberman 2003 delivered 21 mg/day of nicotine for eight weeks.
Three studies had treatment durations of nine weeks (George 2003;
Kahn 2012; Weinberger 2010), one had a treatment duration of
eight weeks (Killen 2010), and one continued therapy for 26 weeks
(Biberman 2003). Three of the studies completed follow-up at six
months (George 2003; Kahn 2012; Killen 2010), and two continued
follow-up to 12 months (Biberman 2003; Weinberger 2010).
Lazabemide

Berlin 2002 is the only study of lazabemide included in this review.
Due to its nature as a dose-finding, exploratory study, its follow-up
period for smoking cessation was only eight weeks. Therefore, we
only consider its data related to harms within this review.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

at a dose of up to 225 mg/day with placebo. All participants also
received nicotine patches and nine brief individual counselling
sessions; follow-up was for 12 months.
Hypericum (St John’s wort)
Three studies of hypericum are included (Barnes 2006; Parsons
2009; Sood 2010), with Barnes 2006 newly included at this update.
These studies took place in the USA (Sood 2010), and the UK
(Barnes 2006; Parsons 2009). Participants were recruited from the
community (Barnes 2006; Sood 2010), and stop-smoking clinics
(Parsons 2009).
All three studies reported prolonged abstinence at six
months. Barnes 2006 compared 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day,
starting one week prior to the target quit date and continuing for 12
weeks thereafter. Parsons 2009 compared 14 weeks of 900 mg/day
of St John's wort to placebo, starting two weeks prior to target quit
date and continuing for 12 weeks thereafter. Sood 2010 compared
900 mg/day, 1800 mg/day, and placebo for 12 weeks.
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)
Sood 2012 is the only study of SAMe included in this review. It
compared 1600 mg/day or 800 mg/day SAMe to placebo for eight
weeks, with smoking cessation follow-up at six months.
Ongoing studies
We identified the following four ongoing studies (two from the
previous review version: NCT03326128; NCT03342027) that may be
relevant for inclusion in the review when complete.
• NCT03326128: compares two doses of bupropion (300 mg/day
to 450 mg/day, starting four weeks prior to and following the
target quit date).
• NCT03342027: a factorial trial comparing bupropion to placebo,
as well as an eight-session tailored behavioural intervention.
• NCT04604509: varenicline or NRT plus bupropion and
counselling compared to varenicline or NRT plus counselling
only.
• NCT05205811: compares 300 mg bupropion plus e-cigarette to
placebo plus e-cigarette.

The study was conducted in both France and Belgium; however,
the method of participant recruitment is not reported. Participants
were given either 50 mg lazabemide, 100 mg lazabemide or
placebo. It was halted early due to liver toxicity observed in trials of
the medication for other indications.

We present further details of these ongoing studies in

Excluded studies

Berlin 2012 is the only study of EVT302 included in this review. Its
follow-up for smoking cessation was only eight weeks. Therefore,
we only consider its data related to harms within this review.

We list our reasons for excluding 105 studies in Characteristics
of excluded studies. Reasons for excluding seven studies at fulltext stage for this update specifically (ChiCTR1900020676; Ghorbani
Behnam 2019; Li 2019; Ruehle 2021; Sanchez 2019; Schiavon 2018;
TCTR20190506002), are also summarised in Figure 1.

The study was conducted in Germany, with participants recruited
through media advertisements. It compared EVT302 monotherapy
(5 mg/day for one week preceding and seven weeks following the
target quit date) with placebo. It additionally compared EVT302
combination therapy with nicotine patch (21 mg/day for seven
weeks post-target quit date) versus placebo EVT302 and nicotine
patch.
Venlafaxine
Cinciripini 2005 is the only study of venlafaxine included in this
review. It recruited from the community and compared venlafaxine

Risk of bias in included studies
Overall, we judged 14 studies to be at low risk of bias (low risk of bias
across all domains), 34 at high risk of bias (high risk of bias in at least
one domain), and the remaining 76 at unclear risk of bias. Reasons
for the judgements made below are detailed in the Characteristics
of included studies table, and a summary illustration of the risk of
bias profile across studies is shown in Figure 2.

Allocation
We assessed selection bias through investigating methods of
random sequence generation and allocation concealment for each
study. We rated 49 studies at low risk for random sequence
generation, one at high risk (Moreno-Coutino 2015), and the
remainder at unclear risk. We judged 34 studies to be at low risk
for allocation concealment, four at high risk, and the remainder
at unclear risk. When assessing both random sequence generation
and allocation concealment, we assessed studies to be at unclear
risk where there was insufficient methodological information
available to be sure whether adequate measures had been taken to
avoid selection bias.
Blinding
We assessed any risk of bias linked to blinding as one domain.
However, we took into account both performance and detection
bias when making this judgement. We judged 36 studies to be at
low risk of bias for this domain, 23 at high risk, and the remainder
at unclear risk. Where studies stated that they were "double-blind"
only, with no explicit clarification of who was blinded, we judged
this to be unclear risk.
Incomplete outcome data
We judged studies to be at a low risk of attrition bias where the
numbers of participants lost to follow-up were clearly reported,
the overall number lost to follow-up was not more than 50%, and
the difference in loss to follow-up between groups was no greater
than 20%. This is in accordance with risk of bias guidance produced
by Cochrane Tobacco Addiction for assessing smoking cessation
studies. We judged 74 of the studies to be at low risk of bias, 15 at
high risk, and the remainder at unclear risk.
Other potential sources of bias
We found five studies with other sources of potential bias
beyond those domains detailed previously. We judged Hilberink
2010 to be at high risk of bias as it was a cluster-RCT that
was not adjusted for clustering effects. Kumar 2020 also did
not adjust for clustering and the baseline characteristics were
unbalanced between arms, resulting in a judgment of high risk
of bias. Siddiqi 2013 demonstrated substantial heterogeneity of
programme effects across the different clusters of their cluster-RCT.
Twenty per cent of participants in the control arm smoked only
hookah (no cigarettes) compared with 4% in the intervention arm.
We judged that this put the study at high risk of bias. The Weiner
2012 study stated that there was insufficient study drug available
to meet demand. It is unclear how this was dealt with and whether
it is accounted for in the dropouts reported. We judged this to
be an unclear risk of bias. Finally, the Zincir 2013 study stated
that there were no adverse events recorded during their study.
This seems highly unlikely according to the common definition of
adverse events, and there is no detail given of how adverse events
were measured in the study. We have therefore judged the study at
high risk of bias for this reason. We judged all remaining studies to
be at low risk.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone for smoking
cessation
Bupropion versus placebo/no pharmacological treatment
Smoking cessation
Pooled data showed bupropion was effective when compared
to placebo or no pharmacological treatment to assist smoking
cessation. Our meta-analysis included 50 trials in which bupropion
was the sole pharmacotherapy, with 18,577 participants (pooled
risk ratio (RR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.72; I2 =
16%; high-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1; Summary of findings
1). The results were not sensitive to the exclusion of studies we
judged to be at high risk of bias overall or studies that received
industry support (see Table 1). We excluded one cluster-RCT of
bupropion versus no pharmacotherapy from our meta-analysis due
to substantial heterogeneity of programme effects across clusters.
This trial detected no clear evidence of a difference between the
bupropion and no pharmacotherapy arms (both groups received
behavioural support) for smoking cessation at any follow-up
point (adjusted RR at 6-month follow-up: 1.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 2.3;
1299 participants), although there was substantial imprecision,
demonstrated by CIs reflecting both potential benefit and harm
of bupropion on quit rates (Siddiqi 2013). In addition, UrdapilletaHerrera 2013 did not report sufficient information for us to
discern the denominators used in their percentage calculations of
cessation. They reported that they found no significant differences
in quit rates at both 6-month (bupropion 48% versus placebo 52%)
and 12-month follow-ups (bupropion 53% versus placebo 47%).
We found no evidence suggesting that the effect of bupropion on
smoking cessation was dependent upon the level of behavioural
support offered to people stopping smoking. Three trials directly
compared bupropion and placebo in factorial designs varying the
behavioural support. There was no evidence from any of the three
trials that the efficacy of bupropion differed between the lower
and higher levels of behavioural support (Hall 2002; McCarthy
2008), or by the type of counselling approach used (Schmitz 2007).
We also carried out a between-study subgroup analysis of the
possible interaction with behavioural support. We did this by
classifying studies into low and high intensities of behavioural
support (further split into delivery to a group or to individuals),
using the criteria set in the Cochrane Review of NRT versus control
(Hartmann-Boyce 2018). Low-intensity support consisted of less
than 30 minutes at the initial consultation, with no more than
two further assessment and reinforcement visits. Only two small
trials met this criteria (Abdelghany 2022; Myles 2004). We found no
evidence of a difference between subgroups (I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.2).
One trial directly compared bupropion and placebo in a cohort
of participants with mental health disorders to a cohort without
(Anthenelli 2016). There was no evidence indicating that the effect
of bupropion depended upon whether people had or did not have a
psychiatric disorder. We also carried out a between-study subgroup
analysis to assess the potential interaction between cessation
rates and mental health disorders. We did this by pooling studies
(or subgroups of studies) into groups, depending upon whether
the participants were recruited specifically because they had a
mental health disorder or they represented the general population
(including some studies that excluded people with current mental
health disorders). Some of these groups included people with
serious mental health disorders, such as people with schizophrenia

(Evins 2001; Evins 2005; George 2002), or other disorders, including
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Hertzberg 2001), and a mix of
mental health disorders (Anthenelli 2016). We found no evidence of
a differential effect of bupropion on cessation between subgroups
(I2 = 15%; Analysis 1.3).
Depression

Four studies comparing bupropion to placebo/no pharmacological
treatment analysed whether there was any interaction between
depression and smoking quit rates (Anthenelli 2016 (analysis
reported in West 2018); Aubin 2004; Cinciripini 2018; Kalman 2011).
We did not find any evidence of this (Table 2).
Harms
A meta-analysis of 21 studies, including 10,931 participants, found
evidence that bupropion resulted in more non-serious adverse
events (AEs) than placebo or a non-pharmacological treatment
(RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.18; I2 = 62%; Analysis 1.4). There
was some evidence of heterogeneity; however, all but one effect
estimate showed the same direction of effect (higher AEs in the
bupropion arms). There was also evidence of higher rates of
psychiatric AEs in the bupropion arms, with much lower levels
of heterogeneity (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36; I2 = 13%; 8
studies, 4494 participants; Analysis 1.5). Looking specifically at
anxiety and insomnia, the effects also demonstrated higher rates
in the bupropion groups (Analysis 1.6; Analysis 1.7). The Perkins
2013 study did not provide sufficient data to be included in
meta-analyses; however, trialists found that AEs experienced by
those in the bupropion and placebo groups were mild, with most
participants reporting no AEs at all. Relative to placebo, people
using bupropion were less likely to report agitation and more likely
to report decreased appetite. The authors deemed these effects to
reflect a relief of withdrawal symptoms, and not actual 'adverse
effects'.
We found moderate-certainty evidence from 10,958 participants in
23 RCTs that rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) were slightly
higher in the bupropion arms than the placebo/no pharmacological
treatment arms; however, there was some imprecision, with 95%
CIs also incorporating no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I2
= 0%; Analysis 1.8; Summary of findings 1). In eight of the studies,
no SAEs were reported and so these studies do not contribute to the
pooled estimate.
Considering specific events, meta-analyses combining seizures
(Analysis 1.9), overdoses (Analysis 1.10), and suicide attempts
(Analysis 1.11) across studies all had point estimates favouring
placebo or no pharmacological treatment but with serious
imprecision: 95% CIs also incorporated lower rates in the
bupropion groups. For death by suicide, only one event was
reported across 14 studies in 8822 participants, which took place
in the placebo/no pharmacological treatment group. All-cause
mortality resulted in an effect estimate favouring bupropion, with
no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) detected; however, there was
substantial imprecision, with 95% CIs incorporating the potential
for both benefit and harm (Analysis 1.13). Analyses 1.9 to 1.13 all
included studies where zero events were reported and so these
studies could not contribute to the pooled estimate.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Tolerability
Twenty-five RCTs, including 12,346 participants, reported dropouts
due to treatment for this comparison. Our meta-analysis provided
high-certainty evidence that there were higher dropout rates due
to treatment when using bupropion than when using placebo or
no pharmacological treatment (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.65; I2 =
2%; Analysis 1.14; Summary of findings 1).
Bupropion plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus
NRT alone
Smoking cessation
There was moderate unexplained statistical heterogeneity and
imprecision when pooling the results of 15 studies comparing
bupropion plus NRT to NRT alone for smoking cessation (RR 1.17,
95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; I2 = 43%; 4117 participants; low-certainty
evidence; Analysis 2.1; Summary of findings 2). Thus, the analysis
found no clear evidence of a benefit of using bupropion plus NRT
over using NRT alone. Ten of the 15 studies used nicotine patches
alone, two studies provided participants with nicotine lozenges
(Piper 2009; Smith 2009), two offered a choice of NRT (Hilberink
2010; Stapleton 2013), and one offered gum alone (Abdelghany
2022). Therefore, none appeared to test combination NRT (patch
and another form) in addition to bupropion. Splitting the analysis
into subgroups by the type of NRT used did not explain the
heterogeneity detected (I2 = 0% for subgroup differences), nor did
the exclusion of studies that did not use a bupropion placebo in
the control arm (Smith 2009; Stapleton 2013). In addition, removing
the six studies deemed to be at an overall high risk of bias did not
change the interpretation of the pooled effect estimate. Sensitivity
analyses excluding studies with industry support did not indicate
that our findings were sensitive to the inclusion of these studies
(see Table 1). Although the direction of the effect estimate changed
when we excluded studies funded by the pharmaceutical industry,
or studies where the pharmaceutical industry had supplied the
medication, 95% CIs still encompassed evidence of benefit as well
as harm.
Depression

Evins 2008 considered smokers with a diagnosis of unspecified
dissociative disorder (major depression, minor depression, or
dysthymic disorder), but due to insufficient follow-up time, the
study data only contribute to analyses of harms and not efficacy.
Harms
A meta-analysis of three studies, including 339 participants, found
evidence that bupropion and NRT in combination resulted in more
non-serious AEs than NRT alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.43; I2 =
0%; Analysis 2.2). There was little evidence reporting on psychiatric
effects, with only one very small study reporting on these generally
(Analysis 2.3). Three studies involving 1218 participants reported on
anxiety specifically. The pooling of these provided some evidence
that rates of anxiety were higher in the bupropion plus NRT
arm compared with the NRT alone arm. However, the CIs also
incorporated the possibility of no difference between treatments,
and there was moderate statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 47%; Analysis
2.4). Two studies with 556 participants provided evidence that rates
of insomnia were higher in the 'bupropion plus NRT' arms (Analysis
2.5).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Evidence from 657 participants in four RCTs resulted in very
imprecise evidence due to a very low number of SAEs (n =
5) reported across all study arms, with 95% CIs incorporating
potential benefit and harm of the intervention, as well as no
difference (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.89; I2 = 0%; low-certainty
evidence; Analysis 2.6; Summary of findings 2). Two of the four
studies did not contribute to the pooled estimate as no SAEs were
reported in the studies.

caution due to substantial statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 78%). Two
studies reported on psychiatric AEs specifically, with the result
again indicating larger numbers in the 'bupropion plus varenicline'
arms (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30; I2 = 7%; 835 participants; Analysis
3.3). Two studies reported on both anxiety (Analysis 3.4) and
insomnia (Analysis 3.5). In both cases, there were higher numbers of
events in the bupropion plus varenicline arms; however, for anxiety,
the lower CI did incorporate the null.

Considering specific events, only single studies reported on
seizures (Analysis 2.7), suicide attempts (Analysis 2.8), and death by
suicide (Analysis 2.9). For the former, one person in the bupropion
plus NRT arm reported a seizure, and in the latter two cases,
no events were reported. Only two studies reported on all-cause
mortality, with a total of five events reported in just one of
the studies. This led to an extremely imprecise effect estimate
favouring the NRT-only arm (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.98; I2 = not
applicable; Analysis 2.10).

Five RCTs reported on SAEs for this comparison, although only
four contributed to the pooled estimate due to a lack of events in
one study. Evidence from 1268 participants resulted in imprecise
evidence, with the 95% CI incorporating potential benefit and harm
of bupropion plus varenicline, as well as no difference (RR 1.23,
95% CI 0.63 to 2.42; I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 3.6;
Summary of findings 3). Johns 2017 did not provide sufficient data
to include in the meta-analysis but reported no difference in the
frequency of SAEs reported between the bupropion plus varenicline
group and the varenicline alone group.

Tolerability

Bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone

Considering specific serious adverse events, no events were
reported in our analyses of seizures or death by suicide (Analysis
3.7; Analysis 3.10). In the cases of overdoses (Analysis 3.8), suicide
attempts (Analysis 3.9), and all-cause mortality (Analysis 3.11),
effect estimates were extremely imprecise, with CIs incorporating
the potential for benefit and harm as well as no difference. In all
three of these latter analyses, some of the studies reported no
events.

Smoking cessation

Tolerability

Our analysis found moderate-certainty evidence that the
combination of bupropion and varenicline may result in higher
smoking cessation rates than varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI
0.95 to 1.55; I2 = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants; Analysis 3.1;
Summary of findings 3). However, the CI also encompassed the
possibility of no clinically significant difference in quit rates. Of
note, Johns 2017 also investigated this comparison but did not
contribute to our meta-analysis due to insufficient data in the
available abstract. The investigators found that, compared to
bupropion monotherapy and varenicline monotherapy, bupropion
in combination with varenicline produced significant increases in
abstinence at six months and presented the following odds ratios
that may relate to this comparison: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.30; OR
1.72, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.67. Either of these ORs would provide further
support for the effects demonstrated in our meta-analysis.

Four RCTs, including 1230 participants, reported dropouts due
to treatment for this comparison. The resulting point estimate
favoured bupropion plus varenicline, but the CI also incorporated a
potential benefit of varenicline alone (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.45;
I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 3.12; Summary of findings
3).

We did not carry out a sensitivity analysis to account for risk of bias
as we did not judge any of the studies in the analysis to be at high
risk. A sensitivity analysis excluding studies with industry support
did not indicate that our findings were sensitive to the inclusion of
these studies (see Table 1).

We also carried out our analyses investigating harms and
tolerability by grouping all of the above comparisons together, as
they all isolated the effect of bupropion.

Depression

Across comparisons, there was evidence to suggest that taking
bupropion increased the incidence of AEs relative to placebo
or no pharmacological treatment, and in combination with NRT
and varenicline in comparison to NRT and varenicline alone (RR
1.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.17; 27 studies, 12,313 participants; Analysis
4.1). However, substantial unexplained heterogeneity was detected
between studies (I2 = 68%). A meta-analysis of 10 studies
found evidence to suggest bupropion increased the likelihood of
developing psychiatric AEs, with CIs excluding no difference (RR
1.23, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.32; 5379 participants; Analysis 4.2). This effect

Three RCTs, including 737 participants, reported dropouts due to
treatment for this comparison. However, one of the studies did
not contribute to the pooled analysis due to a lack of events. The
resulting point estimate favoured NRT alone, although the lower
95% CI incorporated no difference (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.92; I2 =
0%; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 2.11; Summary of findings 2).

None of the relevant included studies investigated a potential link
between depression and quit rates.
Harms
A meta-analysis of four studies, including 1043 participants, found
evidence that bupropion plus varenicline resulted in more nonserious AEs then varenicline alone (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to
1.17; Analysis 3.2); however, this result should be treated with

We carried out sensitivity analyses for all of the above harm and
tolerability analyses for each comparison, removing studies at
overall high risk of bias where this was relevant. In no cases did
this change the interpretation of the effect. Additional sensitivity
analyses, excluding studies with industry support, did not indicate
that our findings were sensitive to the inclusion of these studies
(see Table 1).

is largely driven by Anthenelli 2016 (with an overall weighting of
80.0%); however, as we judged this study to be at low risk of bias,
and the effects are consistent with those detected by the other
studies included in the analysis (I2 = 34%), this was not deemed to
be problematic. A meta-analysis of 30 studies provided evidence
that the use of bupropion may have increased the likelihood of SAEs
(RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.47; I2 = 0%; 12,883 participants; Analysis
4.3). However, the CI encompassed no difference, as well as a
clinically significant increase.
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether bupropion
use was associated with the likelihood of seizures (RR 2.93, 95%
CI 0.74 to 11.54; I2 = 0%; 15 studies, 8092 participants; Analysis
4.4), overdoses (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.21 to 5.99; I2 = 0%; 7 studies,
6135 participants; Analysis 4.5), suicide attempts (RR 0.88, 95% CI
0.25 to 3.14; I2 = 0%; 13 studies, 8027 participants; Analysis 4.6),
death by suicide (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.26; 16 studies, 10,036
participants; I2 = not applicable because only one study reported
an event; Analysis 4.7), or all-cause mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42
to 1.58; I2 = 0%; 24 studies, 12,861 participants; Analysis 4.8). In all
cases, the number of events reported was very low, which resulted
in substantial imprecision and CIs encompassing both clinically
significant benefit and harm.
However, there was evidence that those randomised to receive
bupropion were more likely to report symptoms of anxiety (RR 1.45,
95% CI 1.26 to 1.67; I2 = 30%; 15 studies, 9123 participants; Analysis
4.9) and insomnia (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.59 to 1.88; I2 = 8%; 25 studies,
12,132 participants; Analysis 4.10) at follow-up.
Tolerability
There was evidence that the risk of dropouts due to AEs of
the treatment was higher in groups receiving bupropion across
comparisons (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.60; I2 = 0%; 31 studies,
14,313 participants; Analysis 4.11). Our point estimate suggests
that participants taking bupropion had a 25% to 60% increased
risk of dropping out relative to controls. However, there were
moderate subgroup differences detected (Chi2 = 3.97, degrees of
freedom (df) = 2 (P = 0.14), I2 = 49.6%), with a potential difference
in interpretation between the first two subgroups (bupropion
versus placebo or no pharmacological treatment; bupropion plus
NRT versus NRT alone) and the final subgroup (bupropion plus
varenicline versus varenicline alone). There were considerably
more trials and participants contributing data to the first subgroup
than the second and third, and thus findings of this subgroup
analysis must be treated with caution.
For bupropion versus placebo/no pharmacological treatment
(RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.65; I2 = 2%; 25 studies, 12,346
participants; high-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.14 and Analysis
4.11; Summary of findings 1) and bupropion plus NRT versus
NRT alone (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.92; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 737
participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 2.11 and Analysis
4.11; Summary of findings 2), the point estimate favoured placebo/
no pharmacological treatment or NRT alone, respectively. In the
latter subgroup, the CI crossed the line of no effect; however,
this may have been due to higher levels of imprecision in this
subgroup. In the bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline
alone subgroup, the point estimate favoured bupropion plus
varenicline; however, imprecision was also high in this group,
meaning that the CI encompassed both potential benefit and harm

of findings 3).
Bupropion versus other pharmacotherapies
Smoking cessation
We found evidence to suggest that bupropion may be less effective
than varenicline (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 7564
participants; Analysis 5.1) and combination NRT (i.e. a combination
of nicotine patch and another form of NRT; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to
0.98; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 720 participants; Analysis 6.1) for smoking
cessation. However, there was no clear evidence of a difference in
quit rates between bupropion and single-form NRT (e.g. nicotine
patch or gum alone; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I2 = 0%; 12
studies, 7613 participants; Analysis 6.1). In all cases, removing
studies deemed to be at an overall high risk of bias did not change
the interpretation of the effect estimates.
There was some evidence that bupropion may be more effective
than nortriptyline in aiding smoking cessation (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93
to 1.82; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants; Analysis 7.1). However,
event rates were low (101 participants), and the result imprecise.
This means it is possible that it will change as more evidence
becomes available. The result was similar when we removed one
study judged to be at high risk of bias from the analysis (Hall 2002).
Depression

One post hoc analysis found that bupropion was more effective
than NRT in those with a history of depression (Stapleton 2013).
See Table 2. Only two trials examined the interaction between
depression and quit rates for bupropion and nortriptyline (Hall
2002; Wagena 2005). Both of the within-study analyses found that
participants classified as depressed were more likely to quit using
bupropion than nortriptyline (Table 2).
Harms
There was evidence that randomisation to bupropion resulted in
minimal difference in reporting of AEs when compared to both
varenicline (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.00; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 4332
participants; Analysis 5.2) and NRT (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.06;
I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 4276 participants; Analysis 6.2). For SAEs, point
estimates suggested more SAEs in the bupropion arms. However,
there were far fewer events in these analyses, meaning they were
underpowered, and we can have less certainty in their results (for
varenicline: RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.04; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 4920
participants; Analysis 5.3; for NRT: RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.80; I2
= 19%; 8 studies, 6035 participants; Analysis 6.6). When focusing
on psychiatric AEs only, there was no clear evidence of a difference
when comparing bupropion to varenicline (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99
to 1.16; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 4051 participants; Analysis 5.4). For
psychiatric AEs only, heterogeneity was so high when comparing
bupropion to NRT that we deemed it inappropriate to present a
pooled estimate (I2 = 89%; Analysis 6.3). There was insufficient
evidence to indicate whether bupropion increased the risk of
many of the other harm outcomes assessed (seizures, overdoses,
suicide attempts, death by suicide, and all-cause mortality) when
compared to varenicline and NRT due to a paucity of relevant data.
This means that when we could calculate estimates, these were
extremely imprecise, with CIs encompassing both potential benefit
and harm of the intervention (Analysis 5.7; Analysis 5.8; Analysis 5.9;

Analysis 5.10; Analysis 5.11; Analysis 6.7; Analysis 6.8; Analysis 6.9;
Analysis 6.10; Analysis 6.11).
We also found evidence that participants in the bupropion groups
experienced more insomnia and anxiety than people in the
varenicline groups (insomnia: RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.60; I2 = 9%;
3 studies, 5208 participants; Analysis 5.6; anxiety: RR 1.28, 95% CI
1.07 to 1.53; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 4705 participants; Analysis 5.5) and
the NRT groups (insomnia: RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.55; I2 = 47%; 2
studies, 4128 participants; Analysis 6.5; anxiety: RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06
to 1.62; I2 = 67%; 2 studies, 4855 participants; Analysis 6.4) at followup. However, we detected moderate heterogeneity for both the
insomnia and anxiety outcomes for the comparison to NRT. When
we carried out a sensitivity analysis, removing the study judged to
be at high risk of bias for the anxiety outcome, the 95% CIs shifted to
incorporate no between-group difference in anxiety (RR 1.23, 95%
CI 0.99 to 1.53; I2 = 13%; 1 study, 4028 participants).
We were unable to include two studies in the above metaanalyses. Fatemi 2013 reported that they found no significant
differences between bupropion and varenicline in regards to
side effects. Varenicline specifically did not exhibit a significant
impact on overall depression, psychopathology, suicidality,
mania, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, abnormal dreams, dizziness,
insomnia, chest pain, dry mouth, heart rate and blood pressure,
pain, confusion, or irritability. Johns 2017 found both bupropion
and varenicline to be well tolerated, but participants in the
varenicline group reported increased fatigue, digestive symptoms
(e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), and sleep-related concerns (e.g. abnormal
dreams, insomnia). They reported no difference in the frequency of
SAEs between the bupropion and varenicline groups.
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether bupropion
increased the risk of any harms investigated in this review
when compared to nortriptyline (Analysis 7.2; Analysis 7.3), or
gabapentin – a drug used to treat epilepsy and nerve pain and
not licensed for smoking cessation (Analysis 8.1). In the cases
of Analysis 7.3 (bupropion versus nortriptyline; SAEs) and Analysis
8.1 (bupropion versus gabapentin; SAEs), it was not possible to
generate pooled estimates due to a lack of studies; in the case
of Analysis 7.2 (bupropion versus nortriptyline; insomnia outcome),
statistical heterogeneity was so high that it was not appropriate to
present a pooled estimate (I2 = 90%).
Tolerability
There was some evidence that bupropion may have led to an
increase in trial dropouts due to treatment, when compared to
varenicline (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.39; I2 = 11%; 6 studies, 6111
participants; Analysis 5.12) or NRT (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38;
I2 = 33%; 4 studies, 4825 participants; Analysis 6.12). However,
in both cases, the findings were limited by imprecision, with the
CIs encompassing as many or more dropouts in the comparator,
respectively.
There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether
bupropion increased the risk of trial dropouts due to treatment,
when compared to both nortriptyline (Analysis 7.4) and gabapentin
(Analysis 8.2), with imprecise estimates based on minimal data in
both cases.

high risk of bias. In the rare cases where this was appropriate,
there was no appreciable change in the interpretation of the effect
estimates.
Bupropion at different doses
Smoking cessation
There was no clear evidence to indicate a differential effect between
a 150 mg or 300 mg dose of bupropion on the likelihood of smoking
cessation. Whilst the pooled estimate was 1.08 in favour of a 300
mg dose, the 95% CI encompassed a potential benefit of either
dose (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.26; I2 = 49%; 3 studies, 2042
participants; Analysis 9.1). Removing one study at high risk of bias
did not change the clinical interpretation of the analysis.
Depression

None of the relevant included studies investigated a potential link
between depression and quit rates.
Harms
We were unable to draw conclusions about any of the
harm outcomes for this comparison. Analyses that could be
carried out (SAEs, Analysis 9.4; overdoses, Analysis 9.5; suicide
attempts, Analysis 9.6; death by suicide, Analysis 9.7; all-cause
mortality, Analysis 9.8; insomnia, Analysis 9.3; anxiety, Analysis
9.2), suffered from substantial imprecision due to a low number of
events (ranging from 0 to 99 across the aforementioned analyses),
and in all cases, 95% CIs encompassed one.
Tolerability
Our analysis of dropouts due to adverse event data also suffered
from imprecision (Analysis 9.9), and we were unable to draw
conclusions.
Sensitivity analyses removing studies judged to be at high risk of
bias was not appropriate for harm and tolerability outcomes.
Bupropion of different durations
Smoking cessation
One study looked at the effect of bupropion (300 mg per day) when
taken for seven versus 19 weeks (Rovina 2003). This study found
higher quit rates in the 19-week treatment (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to
2.03; 233 participants; Analysis 10.1).
Depression

Rovina 2003 did not investigate a potential link between depression
and quit rates.
Nortriptyline versus placebo
Smoking cessation
Pooling six trials comparing nortriptyline to placebo showed
evidence of benefit of nortriptyline over placebo for smoking
cessation, with CIs excluding no difference (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to
2.78; I2 = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants; Analysis 11.1). Removing
two studies judged to be at high risk of bias did not influence the
result (Hall 2002; Prochazka 1998).

carried out sensitivity analyses, removing studies judged to be at

Depression

Effects of nortriptyline only across the above comparisons

One within-study comparison found that a past history of
depression did not appear to moderate the efficacy of nortriptyline,
but subgroup numbers were small (Hall 1998). However, another
within-study analysis found that the most effective factor for
ensuring the efficacy of nortriptyline was a negative history of
depression (Da Costa 2002).

Harms

Harms
One study reported on anxiety (Analysis 11.2) and two on insomnia
(Analysis 11.3). Both analyses found higher rates of these AEs in the
nortriptyline arms than the placebo arms. However, the estimates
were imprecise, with CIs incorporating both benefit and harm of the
intervention.
One RCT reported on SAEs for this comparison. Of the 103
participants, none reported serious adverse events (Analysis 11.4).

As for bupropion, we combined the above two nortriptyline
comparisons to investigate harms and tolerability with increased
statistical power. As reported above, only one trial investigated
the likelihood of SAEs across comparisons, with no SAEs reported
in either trial arm (Haggsträm 2006; Analysis 13.1). The insomnia
and anxiety outcomes provided insufficient evidence to draw
conclusions for this comparison (Analysis 13.3; Analysis 13.2).
Tolerability
Our meta-analysis including five studies investigating the isolated
effect of nortriptyline found evidence that dropout due to
treatment was over twice as likely when randomised to
nortriptyline (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.45 to 3.96; I2 = 37%; 5 studies, 695
participants; Analysis 13.4). However, the magnitude of the effect
should be treated with caution due to imprecision.

Tolerability
Four RCTs, including 537 participants, reported dropouts due to
treatment whilst comparing nortriptyline to placebo. The resulting
point estimate favoured nortriptyline (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.36;
I2 = 23%; Analysis 11.5).
Nortriptyline plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus
NRT alone
Smoking cessation
Pooling four trials using nortriptyline as an adjunct to nicotine
patch therapy (Aveyard 2008; Hall 2004; Prochazka 2004; Richmond
2013), found a potential benefit of combination nortriptyline and
NRT for smoking cessation relative to NRT alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI
0.94 to 1.55; I2 = 26%; 4 studies, 1644 participants; Analysis 12.1).
However, there was imprecision around the effect estimate, with
the CIs encompassing both no difference and a clinically significant
benefit. The interpretation of the result remained the same when
we removed studies judged to be at an overall high risk of bias.
Depression

One study comparing nortriptyline plus NRT to NRT alone found no
evidence supporting depression as a moderator of abstinence in
either the combination nortriptyline and NRT or the placebo arms
of the trial (Aveyard 2008).
Harms
One study reported on insomnia with 158 participants, resulting in
CIs incorporating both benefit and harm of the nortriptyline and
NRT versus NRT alone (Analysis 12.2).
No studies reported on SAEs for this comparison.
Tolerability
One RCT, including 158 participants, reported dropouts due to
treatment for this comparison. The resulting point estimate
favoured the NRT-only arm (RR 10.00, 95% CI 1.31 to 76.28; Analysis
12.3), with substantial imprecision due to very few events across
arms (n = 11).

Other antidepressant monotherapies versus control
Smoking cessation
We did not find clear evidence to indicate that selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased the likelihood of smoking
cessation relative to control (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.22; I2 = 0%; 4
studies, 1594 participants; Analysis 14.1). However, there was a low
number of events across studies (193 participants) which should be
taken into account. We subgrouped our meta-analysis by the type
of SSRI used in the trial (two studies on fluoxetine: Niaura 2002;
Spring 2007; one study on paroxetine: Killen 2000; one study on
sertraline: Covey 2002), and found no clear evidence of a subgroup
difference (I2 = 0%). This should be treated with caution due to the
low number of studies in each group.
We found some indication that monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAOIs) may increase the likelihood of smoking cessation relative
to control (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.79; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 827
participants; Analysis 16.1). However, event rates were low (193
participants) resulting in imprecision, and CIs encompassed the
possibility of harm. There was no effect of removing the one
study deemed to be at high risk of bias (George 2003). Our metaanalysis included one trial of moclobemide (Berlin 1995), and five
of selegiline (Biberman 2003; George 2003; Kahn 2012; Killen 2010;
Weinberger 2010), and we subgrouped these accordingly. We did
not identify any evidence of a subgroup difference (I2 = 0%), but this
should be treated with caution as only a single study contributed to
the moclobemide group.
One trial of venlafaxine did not show conclusive evidence of
increased smoking cessation compared to placebo (Cinciripini
2005) (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.32; 1 study, 147
participants; Analysis 17.1). Although the effect estimate was
in favour of venlafaxine, CIs were wide and encompassed both
potential benefit and harm.
Two small trials comparing St John’s wort to placebo provided
no clear evidence to suggest it was a better smoking cessation
treatment than placebo when pooled (Parsons 2009; Sood
2010) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.53; I2 = 29%; 2 studies,
261 participants; Analysis 18.1). However, there was substantial
imprecision.

The one trial assessing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) compared
to placebo provided no evidence of a benefit for smoking cessation
(RR 0.70, CI 0.24 to 2.07; 1 study, 120 participants; Analysis 19.1).
However, the number of included participants and the number of
events were small.
Depression

Of the three studies conducting post hoc analyses of fluoxetine
(Saules 2004; Spring 2007) and paroxetine (Killen 2000) to assess
the interaction between depression and antidepressant quit rates,
none provided evidence to support this interaction (George 2003;
Kahn 2012).
The two studies conducting post hoc analyses of selegiline to assess
the interaction between depression and antidepressant quit rates
also did not provide evidence to support this interaction (George
2003; Kahn 2012).
Harms
There was insufficient evidence to indicate whether SSRIs
increased the risk of AEs relative to placebo. Only two trials of
fluoxetine investigated this, one of which provided data that could
be analysed (NCT00578669; Analysis 14.2). Minami 2014 found that
those in the fluoxetine group reported more symptoms the day
before the set quit date, in comparison to those in the placebo
group. Further, failure to quit on the target quit date could be
significantly predicted by levels of side effects.
For the comparison of MAOIs relative to placebo, there was no clear
evidence of increased risk of experiencing either AEs (Analysis 16.2),
psychiatric AEs (Analysis 16.3), or SAEs (Analysis 16.6). However,
the latter two analyses suffered from substantial imprecision
and should be treated with caution. Substantial imprecision and
heterogeneity also meant that we were unable to draw conclusions
regarding insomnia and anxiety (Analysis 16.4; Analysis 16.5).
The one study assessing harm outcomes for St John's wort versus
placebo did not provide sufficient evidence to assess whether it
increased the likelihood of SAEs or all-cause mortality specifically
(Parsons 2009; Analysis 18.2; Analysis 18.3). A study of SAMe versus
placebo did not provide sufficient evidence on AEs or insomnia
(Sood 2012; Analysis 19.2; Analysis 19.3).

1999; Brown 2014; Saules 2004), but also did not provide evidence
of an increased likelihood of smoking cessation relative to NRT
alone when pooled (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.03; I2 = 0%; 3
studies, 466 participants; Analysis 15.1). Again, interpretation did
not change when we removed studies judged to be at high risk
of bias, and there was evidence of imprecision. In this instance,
CIs encompassed the possibility of no difference and a clinically
significant harm.
Depression

None of these studies investigated depression as a moderator of
abstinence.
Harms
There was insufficient evidence from one study investigating
the effect of selegiline plus NRT versus NRT alone on SAEs
(Biberman 2003; Analysis 20.1). Similarly, Berlin 2012 alone
provides insufficient data to assess the effects of EVT302 plus NRT
versus NRT alone on AEs (Analysis 21.1) and SAEs (Analysis 21.2).
Tolerability
There was insufficient information available about dropout due
to treatment from the one study comparing selegiline plus NRT
versus NRT alone (Biberman 2003; Analysis 20.2), and the one study
comparing EVT302 plus NRT versus NRT alone (Berlin 2012; Analysis
21.3), to draw conclusions.
Other antidepressants at different doses
Smoking cessation
We were unable to evaluate the efficacy of 300 mg versus 600 mg of
St John's wort, as the one trial comparing these differences had too
small a sample size (28 participants), with no individuals abstinent
from smoking at 12 months' follow-up (Barnes 2006). One study
compared the efficacy of 30 mg versus 60 mg of fluoxetine, and
found the same quit rates in both groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to
1.59; 656 participants; Analysis 22.1). However, this result should be
treated with caution due to imprecision.

Tolerability
There was also evidence to suggest SSRIs may increase the
likelihood of dropout due to treatment (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.94;
I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 1270 participants; Analysis 14.3). When the four
included studies were subgrouped into two of fluoxetine (Niaura
2002; Spring 2007), and one of sertraline (Covey 2002), there was no
evidence of a subgroup difference (I2 = 0%).
There was some evidence that there may be an increased risk of
discontinuation in the MAOI groups, and this persisted when we
removed one study judged to be at high risk of bias. However, there
was substantial imprecision in this analysis (Analysis 16.7).
One study each assessed dropout due to treatment for venlafaxine
versus placebo (Cinciripini 2005; Analysis 17.2), St John's wort
versus placebo (Parsons 2009; Analysis 18.4), and SAMe versus
placebo (Sood 2012; Analysis 19.4). These studies did not provide
sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions.

Depression

These studies did not investigate depression as a moderator of
smoking quit rates.
Harms
Berlin 2002 only followed up participants to eight weeks, and
therefore we did not use efficacy data from this study. However,
they reported data on harms. The study compared 100 mg with
200 mg daily doses of lazabemide. No SAEs were recorded during
the trial (Analysis 23.1). There was insufficient evidence to conclude
whether participants randomised to the higher dose were more
likely to suffer from symptoms of insomnia (Analysis 23.3) or anxiety
(Analysis 23.2).
Due to the very small sample size of Barnes 2006, there was
insufficient evidence to assess the likelihood of AEs in participants
receiving a 300 mg daily dose of St. John's wort versus a 600
mg dose (28 participants; Analysis 24.2). Similarly, there was

insufficient evidence investigating the effect of a 800 mg daily dose
of SAMe versus a 1600 mg daily dose on the risk of AEs (Sood 2012;
Analysis 25.1).
Tolerability
Niaura 2002 found some evidence that a 60 mg daily dose of
fluoxetine compared to a 30 mg dose daily increased the likelihood
of trial discontinuation due to treatment (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to
0.87; 1 study, 656 participants; Analysis 22.2). However, there was
insufficient evidence to conclude whether participants randomised
to the higher 200 mg dose of lazabemide were more likely to drop
out of the trial due to the medication than participants randomised
to the lower 100 mg dose (Berlin 2002; Analysis 23.4), or whether
participants randomised to a 1600 mg dose of SAMe were more
likely to drop out than those randomised to a 800 mg dose (Sood
2012; Analysis 25.2).

DISCUSSION
Summary of main results
This updated review summarises and evaluates the evidence
investigating the efficacy, harms, and tolerability of different types
of antidepressant for smoking cessation. This review includes a
total of 124 studies involving 48,832 participants, adding 10 new
studies to the previous review version (Howes 2020). A total of
50 trials of 18,577 participants provide a large, high-certainty
evidence base confirming the benefit of bupropion used as a single
pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation (Summary of findings 1).
The pooled estimate suggests that bupropion increased long-term
quitting success by 49% to 72% when compared with placebo
or no pharmacological treatment. Treatment effects appeared
to be comparable across the range of populations, settings,
and types of behavioural support studied, including those with
and without a past history of depression. Our review finds
insufficient evidence of a benefit of adding bupropion to nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) when compared to NRT alone (lowcertainty evidence; Summary of findings 2), although there was
some indication that adding bupropion to varenicline treatment
may result in higher quit rates than when compared to varenicline
alone (moderate-certainty evidence; Summary of findings 3).
There is evidence to suggest that bupropion increases the risk
of non-serious adverse events (AEs), including psychiatric AEs,
when compared to placebo or no pharmacological treatment.
However, rates of SAEs were low and estimates incorporated
the potential of no difference in the number of SAEs reported
between arms (moderate-certainty evidence; Summary of findings
1). There was, however, high-certainty evidence that more people
dropped out due to treatment when using bupropion than when
using placebo or no pharmacological treatment (Summary of
findings 1). Although non-serious AEs were also found to be
higher in the combination treatment arms (i.e. bupropion plus
NRT when compared to NRT alone and bupropion plus varenicline
when compared to varenicline alone), results for SAEs and rates
of dropouts were inconclusive (low-certainty evidence in all
cases; Summary of findings 2; Summary of findings 3).
The evidence suggests that people using bupropion may be more
likely to quit than those using nortriptyline, but does not clearly
suggest evidence of a difference in the efficacy of bupropion versus
single-form NRT. Participants taking bupropion may be less likely
to quit than those treated with varenicline, and combined NRT.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

The evidence relating to the harms of treatment is inconclusive
when comparing bupropion to NRT, varenicline, and nortriptyline,
due to a paucity of studies, overall participants, and events. While
our review did not specifically consider tobacco users with severe
mental illness, subgroup analysis of a large included trial indicates
the benefits of bupropion, NRT, and varenicline, with no treatmentrelated increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events in this cohort
(Anthenelli 2016; Evins 2021).
We found evidence that nortriptyline is also an effective agent to
aid smoking cessation when compared with placebo, based on a
meta-analysis of six studies, including 975 participants. However,
there is no clear evidence that other antidepressants, including
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), venlafaxine, St John's wort, and
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), are effective as cessation
treatments. Therefore, despite SSRIs being commonly used to
treat depression, there does not seem to be any justification for
continuing to pursue their use for smoking cessation, where other
more clearly effective options exist.
Few studies examined whether current or previous depression
moderated the effectiveness of antidepressants to aid smoking
cessation. Those comparing bupropion to placebo or no
pharmacological treatment found no evidence of an interaction
between depression and use of bupropion. Studies contributing to
other comparisons found varied but uncertain results.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
The searches conducted for this study were broad and
identified any studies where a drug was described as being an
'antidepressant' or 'antidepressive'. In cases where we were unsure
of whether a medication was classed as an antidepressant, we
conducted a brief literature search to clarify whether they had been
used in other research as antidepressants, to ensure we included
all relevant medications. We also searched trial registers to identify
any ongoing or completed but unpublished, registered studies
assessing the efficacy and harms of antidepressants for smoking
cessation.
Most studies included in this review recruited adult smokers who
were typically motivated to quit; four studies recruited young
people aged between 12 and 21 years. Of the study populations
included in our review, the lowest mean cigarettes smoked per day
was 10, and the highest was 44, meaning that most studies included
participants with significant tobacco addiction. These results may
not apply to populations with few symptoms of tobacco addiction.
In addition, few studies specifically recruited participants with
mental health disorders; one was weighted particularly heavily
in the meta-analysis (Anthenelli 2016). Anthenelli 2016 recruited
a subset of participants with mental health disorders, who were
described as 'clinically stable', suggesting that they may not be
entirely representative of the wider population diagnosed with a
mental health disorder. Further studies are needed amongst those
with depression to provide greater confidence in our findings,
which suggest that bupropion is as effective for smoking cessation
in people with a mental health diagnosis as those without.

Certainty of the evidence
Of the 124 studies included in this review, we judged 14 to be at low
risk of bias for all domains, and 34 to be at high risk in one or more

domains. We judged the remaining 76 studies to be at an unclear
risk due to a lack of reporting of key information. In these cases, it
is impossible to know whether these studies were at any risk of bias
or whether the information was simply not reported. To investigate
the potential impact on results of studies that we judged to be
at high risk of bias, we carried out sensitivity analyses, removing
studies judged to be at high risk from analyses and observing the
effects on results (where this was possible). In most cases, this had
no effect on the clinical interpretation of the analyses.
We assessed the certainty of the evidence by creating three
summary of findings tables (Summary of findings 1; Summary
of findings 2; Summary of findings 3) and carrying out GRADE
ratings for three comparisons (bupropion versus placebo/no
pharmacological treatment; bupropion plus NRT versus NRT
alone; bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone)
(Schünemann 2013). The efficacy of bupropion versus placebo/
no pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation generated
high-certainty evidence. We judged combination bupropion and
varenicline evidence to be of moderate certainty, whilst we
judged the combination bupropion and NRT to be of low-certainty
evidence. We judged the SAE outcome as moderate certainty for
bupropion versus placebo/no pharmacological treatment, and low
certainty for both bupropion plus NRT versus NRT alone and
bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone. The evidence
on dropout due to treatment was deemed to be high certainty
for bupropion versus placebo/no pharmacological treatment, and
again low certainty for both bupropion plus NRT versus NRT
alone and bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone.
The reasons for downgrading the evidence were imprecision

(confidence intervals (CIs) encompassing no difference, as well
as the potential for both benefit and harm), and inconsistency
(moderate heterogeneity detected in an analysis).

Potential biases in the review process
We consider the review process used to be robust, and do
not believe we have introduced any biases. However, Cochrane
guidance to screen all reference lists of included studies and
relevant reviews has not been followed for all updates of this
review.
For outcome assessment, we followed the standard methods used
for Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group cessation reviews. Our
search of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Specialised Register
allowed us to capture two new ongoing studies (resulting in a total
of four ongoing studies). However, there may be unpublished data
that our searches did not uncover.
We generated and interpreted funnel plots for all analyses that
included 10 or more studies that were also eligible for inclusion in
our summary of findings table (i.e. the most clinically important).
None of the funnel plots appeared to demonstrate evidence of
publication bias (Figure 3; Figure 4; Figure 5). However, in the cases
of Figure 4 and Figure 5, relatively few studies contributed to these
plots (17 and 15, respectively), so these should be interpreted with
caution. We also tested whether the inclusion of studies funded by
the pharmaceutical industry or where a pharmaceutical company
had supplied the medication for the study impacted the pooled
results of our analyses. In no case did there appear to be any clear
evidence of this (Table 1).

We considered participants lost to follow-up as smokers, which is
the current best practice in this field (West 2005). The Cochrane
Tobacco Addiction Group policy is to present effect estimates as risk
ratios (RRs), as these are easier to interpret than odds ratios (ORs).
However, this means that where there are no events measured in
both comparison groups, RRs cannot be calculated, and therefore
do not contribute to the meta-analysis. We considered alternative
statistical approaches to deal with this but concluded that other
approaches would be more difficult to interpret and that overall
conclusions would not change as a result.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews
The findings of this review align with the conclusions of
other reviews and guidelines in a variety of populations (Cahill
2013; Hughes 2005; McRobbie 2005; Mills 2006, Tsoi 2010). The
most recent US Preventative Task Force 2021 recommendation
statements for pharmacotherapy state that bupropion is an
effective smoking cessation treatment, and that varenicline
appears to be more effective than bupropion or NRT (Patnode
2021). In the UK, bupropion, NRT, and varenicline (when available)
are recommended for people over the age of 18 (NICE 2021).
Open uncontrolled trials and observational studies of bupropion
have shown real-life quit rates comparable to those found in the
clinical trials included in this review (Paluck 2006; Wilkes 2005). In

addition, our findings regarding the beneficial effect of bupropion
for smoking cessation, specifically in smokers living with mental
illness, are consistent with a subset from a separate Cochrane
Review evaluating smoking cessation treatments exclusively in
populations with current or past depression (Van der Meer 2013).
However, our findings on the effectiveness of bupropion as an
adjunct to NRT differ from the results of the United States Public
Health Service (USPHS) clinical practice guideline (Fiore 2008).
Whereas we did not detect clear evidence of a difference in efficacy
when bupropion and NRT were used together compared to NRT
alone, the USA guideline reported an OR of 1.30 (95% CI 1.0
to 1.80) favouring combination therapy (Fiore 2008, Table 6.28).
The difference in meta-analytic outcomes may be because our
analysis included several studies of hard-to-treat populations not
included in the USPHS analysis. Also, it could be because our
analysis was a collation of 15 direct, within-study randomised
comparisons, whereas the USPHS carried out an indirect acrossstudy comparison of the results from the combination arms of three
trials and the patch-alone arms of 32 studies.
Thomas 2022 and Cahill 2013 used both direct and indirect
statistical comparisons to compare the efficacy of bupropion to NRT
and varenicline, using network meta-analysis. The effect estimates
generated resulted in similar conclusions to the ones drawn here;
namely, bupropion and single-form NRT resulted in similar quit

rates and varenicline and combination NRT resulted in higher quit
rates than bupropion.
Similar to our findings, other studies and systematic reviews
looking at the SAE profile of bupropion are subject to uncertainty
(Cahill 2013; Grandi 2011; Wightman 2010). However, the recent
network meta-analysis, Thomas 2022, found that, unlike NRT
and varenicline, only bupropion at a standard dose increased
the odds of SAEs compared to placebo. Our review also found
moderate-certainty evidence that SAEs may increase as a result
of taking bupropion but this may change as more evidence
becomes available. Our review did not find conclusive evidence
that bupropion significantly increases the incidence of seizures due
to substantial imprecision (RR 2.93, 95% CI 0.74 to 11.54). Due to the
very low number of events (n = 7), the point estimate indicated a
rate of 0 events per 1000 people taking bupropion, compared to a
rate of 1 per 1000 cases presented elsewhere (Cahill 2013).
In contrast to the findings of the very large-scale EAGLES trial
(Anthenelli 2016), we have concluded that bupropion significantly
increases psychiatric AEs. Whilst Anthenelli 2016 contributes over
95% of psychiatric AE data to our meta-analysis, it concluded
that bupropion does not significantly increase the incidence of
psychiatric AEs. This discrepancy may be the result of including
psychiatric AEs of any severity in our relevant meta-analysis,
whereas Anthenelli 2016 used a composite measure of only
moderate- and severe-intensity psychiatric events for their primary
analysis. We cannot establish whether we would find the same if
we were only to include moderate and severe psychiatric events,
as study reporting does not allow us to discriminate between these
events according to severity.
Taking into account (1) the combined evidence from this
review, Cahill 2013, and Thomas 2022, suggesting that varenicline
and combination NRT are more efficacious than bupropion;
(2) evidence from Livingstone-Banks 2023 suggesting that
psychiatric AEs are not increased by varenicline; and (3) evidence
from Hartmann-Boyce 2018 and Theodoulou 2023 raising a lack of
concerns around harms emerging from the use of NRT, varenicline
(where available) or combination NRT may be more suitable
options for people who wish to use a medication to quit smoking,
especially those with mental health disorders.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Implications for practice
• Bupropion and nortriptyline are effective pharmacological
treatments for smoking cessation. There is limited evidence that
bupropion may be more effective than nortriptyline. Bupropion
increases the rate of long-term quitting by approximately 49%
to 72%, and this effect appears to be stable regardless of
the amount of behavioural support provided, and whether
participants have current or a history of mental health disorders.
• Bupropion may cause an increase in adverse events (AEs),
and specifically psychiatric AEs, leading to discontinuation of
drug use in some users (approximately 9%). There is also
evidence that bupropion may cause an increase in serious
adverse events (SAEs; i.e. events that result in hospitalisation,
disability, or death). However, estimates include the possibility
of no difference as well as a potential 1% increase versus no use
of bupropion.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• There is some evidence, limited by imprecision, that combining
bupropion with varenicline may result in greater quit rates than
using varenicline alone. However, there is less certain evidence
of higher quit rates when combining bupropion with nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) relative to NRT alone, although this
may change as more evidence becomes available.
• There is some evidence that bupropion is as effective as singleform nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation;
however, it appears to be less effective than combination NRT
(i.e. a patch combined with another form).
• There is a paucity of data investigating the efficacy and harms
of antidepressants other than bupropion for smoking cessation.
However, there are sufficient data to show that, in the light
of the effectiveness of other medications, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) offer no worthwhile increase in
smoking cessation rates.
• The evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about whether
existing depression modifies the efficacy of antidepressants for
smoking cessation.

Implications for research
There is high-certainty evidence that bupropion increases quit rates
at six months or longer in adults motivated to quit. We consider
that further research is highly unlikely to change our confidence
in the efficacy of bupropion in this population. However, further
studies could increase our confidence in the likelihood of SAEs
and dropouts due to treatment. Any future studies comparing
bupropion to placebo should ensure these outcomes are recorded
and reported in detail.
• More studies assessing the efficacy and harms of different doses
of bupropion, as well as doses higher than 300 mg, would clarify
the most effective bupropion dosing strategy.
• More high-quality studies are needed to assess the efficacy of
bupropion when combined with varenicline treatment or NRT
treatment.
• More high-quality studies are needed to assess whether
bupropion is particularly efficacious for supporting smoking
cessation in people with depression.
• New studies of any antidepressant used as a treatment for
smoking cessation should ensure that they measure and report
on the number of participants experiencing SAEs and AEs, as
well as reporting on the number of dropouts due to treatment.
These numbers should be reported separately by study arm, as
well as overall. Specifically, studies of bupropion should report
on numbers of psychiatric AEs and provide more detail on the
severity of these events.

CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDIES
Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Abdelghany 2022
Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: RCT
Country: Egypt
Setting: Chest medicine outpatient clinic
Recruitment method: patients from the clinic

Participants

100 smokers randomised; 3% female, average age 33; average cigarettes per day unknown, median FTND 6-8

Interventions

•
•
•
•

Placebo, 12 weeks
Nicotine gum, 2 or 4 mg, 12 weeks
Bupropion, 300 mg, 12 weeks
Nicotine gum (2 or 4 mg) and Bupropion (300 mg), 12 weeks

Common components: personalised counselling sessions were offered to all participants in the first visit lasting for about 10 to 15 minutes; subsequent weekly follow-up visits were encouraged
Outcomes

• Smoking cessation: point prevalence at 26 weeks. Validated by CO < 6 ppm
• Adverse events: measured for 26 weeks

Funding Source

Quote: "Nil."

Author conflicts of interest

Notes
Risk of bias
Bias

Authors' judgement

Support for judgement

Random sequence generation (selection bias)

Low risk

Quote: "Simple randomization by using procedures such as coin-tossing or
dice-rolling"

Allocation concealment
(selection bias)

Low risk

Quote: "Sealed opaque envelopes... Participants were randomized (via sealed
envelopes) and allocated to one of 4 groups"

Blinding (performance
bias and detection bias)
All outcomes

Unclear risk

The record claims that the study is placebo-controlled, however only a bupropion placebo is described. The study is only single-blind.

Incomplete outcome data
(attrition bias)
All outcomes

High risk

Overall loss to follow-up was less than 50%, but the difference between the
nicotine gum and bupropion arms was more than 20%.

Other bias

Low risk

None detected

Detection bias is minimised as cessation was biochemically verified.

Study design: RCT
Country: USA
Setting: no information available
Recruitment method (quote): "Participants were recruited by advertisement and physician referral"

Participants

49 smokers living with unipolar depressive disorder (major depression, minor depression, or dysthymic
disorder) randomised; 49% female, average age 43; average cigarettes per day 25

Interventions

• Transdermal nicotine patches plus placebo pill. Patches: 21 mg for weeks 2 to 6, and 14 mg/day for
weeks 7 to 8, and 7 mg/day for weeks 9 to 10
• Transdermal nicotine patches plus bupropion SR. Patches: 21 mg for weeks 2 to 6, and 14 mg/day for
weeks 7 to 8, and 7 mg/day for weeks 9 to 10. Bupropion: 150 mg for first 3 days then 150 mg twice daily
Common components: Quote "All subjects received 13 sessions of group CBT, 8 weeks of NRT, and 12
weeks of either bupropion SR or identical placebo during the 13-week acute treatment phase."

Outcomes

Smoking cessation: investigators intended to measure cessation at 12-month follow-up; however, due
to high loss to follow-up, they do not report this. Therefore, cessation data are only reported to 13week follow-up and are not included in this review, in-line with our inclusion criteria.
Adverse events: measured for 13 weeks, although these are not reported in the paper, other than in the
form of dropouts due to adverse events.

Participants

All participants were between 12 and 21 years
134 participants randomised; 41.8% female; average age 18.5; average cigarettes per day 10.8; mean
FTND 4.2

Interventions

• Bupropion and contingency management. 150 mg once daily for three days, then 150 mg twice daily for remainder of 6-week treatment period. Contingency management consisted of monetary compensation for biologically verified abstinence at visits. Abstinence at the first visit was 10 USD (dollars),
with subsequent consecutive abstinent visits escalating by USD 3 (USD 13, USD 16, USD 19, and so
on). If a participant relapsed, he or she was not eligible for contingent compensation at that visit, and
the contingent reward for the next abstinent visit was reset to USD 10 (with eligibility to escalate by
USD 3 at subsequent abstinent visits). Thus, the maximum amount of compensation throughout the
6-week treatment period was USD 275.
• Bupropion and non-contingency management. Bupropion given according to schedule above. Noncontingency management consisted of fixed compensation (USD 10 per visit) for attending the twiceweekly treatment visits.
• Matched placebo and contingency management
• Matched placebo and non-contingency management
All participants received smoking cessation booklets and were eligible for a weekly bonus payment of
USD 5 throughout active treatment for completion of study materials, including daily smoking diaries.
In addition, all participants received USD 30 for completing the initial assessment visit, USD 20 for completing the initial medication management visit, and USD 20 for completing the final post-treatment
follow-up visit.

Outcomes

• Smoking cessation: 12 weeks - too short a follow-up for this outcome to be considered in this review
• Adverse events: measured for 6 weeks

participants in the standard counselling arm appear to have been more highly addicted than bupropion arm, i.e. smoking more, for longer. Dependence,
number of cigarettes smoked per day, all higher in control than intervention.
There was also no evidence that analysis has been adjusted for clustering.

Factorial design crossing 2 drug doses with 2 intensities of behavioural counselling:
• Bupropion 300 mg/day versus 150 mg/day
• Free and Clear proactive telephone counselling (4 brief calls), access to quit-line and S-H materials
versus Zyban Advantage Program (ZAP) tailored S-H materials, single telephone call after TQD, access
to Zyban support line

Outcomes
• Smoking cessation: 7-day ppa at 12 months. Validation method not specified

Notes

Based on published data from 2004
No dose/behavioural treatment interaction at 12 months so arms combined to compare 300 mg versus
150 mg doses.
Effects differed at 3 months and 12 months. Effect of higher dose disappeared and additional support
aided people to make repeated quit attempts.

Participants

Participants had a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder made through a best estimate diagnostic approach.
46 participants randomised; 19.6% female; average age 49; average cigarettes per day 44.0; mean FTND
5.8

Interventions

• Bupropion 150 mg daily for 3 days, then 150 mg twice daily from day 4 onwards, through 12 weeks
• Placebo, dose and scheduling the same as bupropion
All participants had a 9-week group support programme led by staff trained in the education model of
the American Cancer Society FreshStart Program modified for people with schizophrenia. Each session
was structured and incorporated relation exercises with practice “homework”. The first group sessions
were designed to increase awareness of specific smoking habits and to develop a ‘Quit Plan’. A Quit Day
Ceremony was held at the fifth group session. Subsequent sessions focused on reworking the Quit Plan.
Later groups focused on strategies for participants minimising weight gain, managing high risk situations, and imagining themselves as non-smokers.

Outcomes

• Smoking cessation: 14 weeks - too short a follow-up for this outcome to be considered as part of this
review

High risk

Quote: "questionnaires were distributed consecutively to all attending patients on the target days by nurses. Thus, the assignment of patients was entirely dependent on the consecutive attendance of patients and the random
assignment of a color. Doctors were not allowed to interfere with this study
procedure." But numbers allocated to groups very uneven and discussion
states: "Random checks of this procedure [randomisation] and quality assurance tests by study monitors revealed that in some cases in the latter part of
the study treatment was based on patient and physician preferences."

Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: RCT
Country: Turkey
Setting: outpatient smoking cessation clinic in a hospital
Recruitment method: patients who presented at the smoking cessation outpatient clinic were included
in the study on a voluntary basis

Participants

300 participants randomised; average age: 45.8 in those who stopped smoking and 40.8 in those who
continued smoking; average boxes of cigarettes per year: 23.62 in those who stopped smoking and
23.26 in those who continued smoking; mean FTND: 5.9 in those who stopped smoking and 6.7 in those
who continued smoking

Interventions

• Bupropion 150 mg/day, started a week before the quit day and continued from days 1 to 3, raised to
300 mg daily on day 4, with this dose maintained until the end of week 12
• Varenicline 0.5 mg daily, raised to 1 mg daily at day 4, then to 2 mg daily at day 8, with this dose maintained until the end of week 12
• Nicotine replacement therapy. Administered using either a nicotine patch or nicotine gum, or a combination of both. Nicotine patches were used in their three forms containing 21 mg, 14 mg and 7 mg
of nicotine, and in cases of excessive nicotine craving, 2 mg nicotine gum was used. For each dose
of nicotine patches, 4 weeks of administration in decreasing doses was recommended. The nicotine
gum was started between 12 and 24 doses (2 mg) a day and gradually decreased.

Outcomes

• Smoking cessation: definition not specified; measured at 24 to 28 weeks from study start
• Adverse events: measured for unspecified period

All outcomes

Unclear risk

300 participants were randomised and 251 completed the study. Therefore
49/300 (16.3%) were lost to follow-up overall. However, it is impossible to establish the number lost to follow-up by group.

Other bias

High risk

Quote: “no adverse event was reported during the study”. This is highly unlikely to be correct when considering standard definitions of adverse events.
There is no explanation of how adverse events were assessed in this study. In
addition, the wording of the paper makes the final follow-up slightly unclear.
After discussion, we judged final follow-up to be 24 to 28 weeks from study
start, although quit rates were higher than would be expected at this time
point.

Study ID

Antidepressant

Direction of relationship

Evidence for interaction

Anthenelli 2016

Bupropion

None

"Varenicline, bupropion and NRT were all effective in smokers
with mental health problems (assessed with a number of variables, e.g. diagnostic history, HADS, use of psychotropic medication), and their relative efficacy was similar to that in smokers without a psychiatric history."

Aubin 2004

Bupropion

None

"A similar subgroup analysis performed according to previous
history of depression (evaluated by the MINI questionnaire) also failed to reveal an interaction with bupropion treatment."

Aveyard 2008

Nortriptyline

None

"Participants randomised to nortriptyline plus nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation experienced less depression (OR 0.15) and anxiety early in the quit attempt when the
risk of return to smoking is at its highest than those randomised
to placebo plus nicotine replacement therapy. Contrary to expectations, no evidence was found that this led to greater abstinence."

Cinciripini 2018

Bupropion

None

"Several measures failed to demonstrate significant effects as a
function of time, treatment, or the interaction of treatment and
time. For example, CES-D scales including Depressive Affect, Interpersonal Relations, Positive Affect, and Somatic Symptoms,
failed to demonstrate any effects of treatment or any treatment
by time interactions."

Da Costa 2002

Nortriptyline

Negative

"The best results were obtained with educational intervention,
in those patients having no personal history of depression, who
received the active drug. A negative history of depression was,
however, the most important factor for the success of the treatment."

George 2003

Selegiline

None (history), negative (current)

“There was no significant influence of a past history of major
depression on smoking cessation outcomes (B = -0.49, SE =
0.90, Wald Statistic = 0.29, df = 1, p = .59), and when past history of major depression was entered into the logistic regression model as a covariate, it did not predict treatment failure
with selegiline study medication (medication past history of depression status interaction: B = -0.02, SE = 1.03, Wald statistic
= 0.00, df = 1, p = .98)." and "Furthermore, bivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that having depressive symptoms
at baseline negatively predicted smoking cessation outcomes
with SEL on this continuous abstinence measure (B = 18.9, SE =
0.58, Wald statistic = 1048.9, df = 1, P < .01)."

Hall 2002

Bupropion, nortriptyline

Positive (for bupropion)

“There were higher abstinence rates for bupropion than nortriptyline for participants with a history of depressive disorder"

Kahn 2012

Selegiline

None

"At the final HAM-D assessment, the selegiline group (n = 90) reported a mean increase of 0.41 points and the placebo group
(n = 85) reported a mean increase of 0.21 points. The difference
between treatment groups was not statistically significant (t
test, p = .65)."

Kalman 2011

Bupropion

None

“Interaction effects between medication and tobacco dependence and medication and depressive symptoms were also
nonsignificant.”

Killen 2000

Paroxetine

None

"A stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to examine
the association of abstinence at Week 26 with the variables [including depression scores] listed in Table 1. None of these variables were prospectively associated with abstinence."

Saules 2004

Fluoxetine

None

“Examination of pre-specified subgroups (i.e., gender, race, and
history of major depressive disorder) did not reveal significant
differences in smoking cessation by group”

Spring 2007

Fluoxetine

None

Fluoxetine initially enhanced cessation for smokers with a history of major depression (P = .02) but subsequently impaired
cessation regardless of depressive history.

Stapleton 2013

Bupropion

Positive

“There was some evidence that the relative effectiveness of
bupropion and NRT differed according to depression (χ2 = 2.86,
P = 0.091), with bupropion appearing more beneficial than NRT
in those with a history of depression (29.8 versus 18.5%)."

Wagena 2005

Bupropion, nortriptyline

Positive (for bupropion)

“Results indicated that bupropion SR [sustained release] treatment was efficacious in helping smokers who were classified
as depressed in achieving prolonged abstinence from smoking
throughout the 26-week period. The number of depressed participants from the nortriptyline-treated group was considered
too low to study this relationship."

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROTOCOL AND REVIEW
We made the changes below for the 2023 update.
• For pragmatic reasons, we only generated funnel plots for the most clinically relevant comparisons and outcomes (i.e. those included
in our summary of findings tables).
• As piloted in the previous version of the review, we combined analyses of harms and tolerability for bupropion only across the relevant
comparisons, to increase the power of our analyses. We continued to subgroup according to the relevant comparison.
• We screened previously excluded studies for a complementary network meta-analysis (Lindson 2022), and through duplicate
consensus, included some studies that were formerly excluded from previous updates of this review.
• We discovered that two references to the same study had been included as separate studies in the previous update of the review. In that
version of the review, this study did not contribute to meta-analyses and therefore did not threaten their integrity. We have combined
the references in this version of the review under the study ID Weinberger 2008.

NOTES
This review was first published as part of the review 'Anxiolytics and antidepressants for smoking cessation.' From Issue 4, 2000 the classes
of drugs were reviewed separately.

Abstract: Background: Poor adherence to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is associated with
low rates of smoking cessation. Hence, this study aims to identify and map patient-related factors
associated with adherence to NRT using the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behaviour
(COM-B) model. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching five databases
(MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) and grey literature on 30 August 2020. Data
were extracted, thematically analysed, and mapped to the COM-B model. The Joanna Briggs Institute
(JBI) critical appraisal tool was utilised to assess the quality of studies. Results: A total of 2929 citations
were screened, and 26 articles with a total of 13,429 participants included. Thirty-one factors were
identified and mapped to COM-B model: psychological capability (forgetfulness, education), physical
capability (level of nicotine dependence, withdrawal symptoms), reflective motivation (perception
about NRT and quitting), automatic motivation (alcohol use, stress, depression), physical opportunity
(cost), and social opportunity (social support). The most prominent element associated with adherence
was reflective motivation followed by physical capability and automatic motivation. Conclusions:
Multiple personal, social, and environmental factors affect NRT adherence. Hence, it is recommended
to implement a multifaceted behavioural intervention incorporating factors categorised under the
COM-B model, which is the hub of the behaviour change wheel (BCW) to improve adherence
and quitting.

1. Backgrounds
Tobacco smoking is one of the main public health concerns that the world has ever faced [1].
Since the adoption of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control (FCTC) in 2003, tremendous efforts have been made to scale-up tobacco control [2–4]. Smoking
cessation is one of the most important and cost-effective preventive health measures to reduce the
risk of mortality and morbidity [5,6]. Smoking cessation is associated with substantial positive
health outcomes, and evidence suggests that smoking cessation medications are offered in addition to
behavioural therapy [7].

One factor that has been shown to have a direct effect on the success of smoking cessation
treatment is adherence to smoking cessation medications [8]. A review conducted in 2020 by
Mersha et al. showed that adherence to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) doubles the success
of smoking cessation (OR = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.34–3.51) [9]. A literature review conducted by Pacek
et al. which included participants utilising any type of smoking cessation medications such as
varenicline, bupropion, and NRT, classified factors associated with adherence to smoking cessation
medications into preventable and non-preventable factors. The non-preventable factors include
sociodemographic, medical comorbidities, genetic, and personality factors [10]. Male sex [11,12], older
age [8,13], and greater educational status [14] were found to increase the level of adherence to smoking
cessation medications. Low socioeconomic status and having depressive symptoms were found to
reduce the level of adherence in most of the studies [15–17]. Preventable factors associated with
adherence to smoking cessation medications include belief about the safety and efficacy of smoking
cessation medications [18].
In the behaviour change wheel (BCW), which is broadly utilised to design and implement
successful behavioural change interventions, the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behaviour
(COM-B) model is at the hub of the wheel. The COM-B model suggests that behaviour is the result of an
interaction between three components: capability, opportunity, and motivation. These components are
further divided into six subcomponents: psychological capability, physical capability, social opportunity,
physical opportunity, automatic motivation, and reflective motivation [19]. The components of the
COM-B model are encircled by nine intervention functions (education, persuasion, incentivisation,
coercion, training, restriction, environmental restructuring, modelling, enablement) and seven policy
categories (communication, guidelines, fiscal, regulation, legislation, environmental/social planning,
and service provision) in the BCW [20]. This representation in the BCW makes suggestion of possibly
effective strategies easy and targeted to components of the COM-B model.
Among the smoking cessation medications, NRT has the lowest half-life, especially nicotine gum
and spray, with a maximum of two to three hours; whereas, the half-life of bupropion and varenicline is
22 and 24 h to ease adherence as compared to NRT [21,22]. Moreover, the rates of adherence were 63 and
74% for varenicline and bupropion, respectively [23,24]. Adherence to NRT is inconsistent between
26 to 61%, given the difficulty of the dosing schedule [9]. Although, a literature review conducted in
2018 aimed at classifying factors as preventable and nonpreventable [10], the current review utilised
the COM-B model to understand factors and BCW to discuss and suggest interventions [20].
A detailed understanding of the barriers and facilitators of adherence to NRT is crucial for the
development of comprehensive and effective interventions that can improve the success of smoking
cessation. This systematic review aims to identify barriers and facilitators of adherence to NRT and to
map the identified factors into the six sub-components of the COM-B model. As the COM-B model is
the heart of the BCW, it will guide researchers and policymakers to develop targeted strategies that
may improve adherence to NRT and smoking cessation [20].
2. Methods
This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [25]. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO
(registration number CRD42020186621), available from https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_
record.php?ID=CRD42020186621 [26]. This review followed five steps utilised by similar previously
published reviews [27,28]: (1) review scope defined; (2) literature search conducted; (3) citations
screened for inclusion; (4) data extracted and associated factors identified; and finally, (5) identified
factors mapped to COM-B model.
2.1. Selection Criteria
Population: Studies that enrolled individuals using NRT for smoking cessation were included in
the systematic review. Studies were included without restriction for age and medical condition.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 8895

3 of 21

Intervention: The interventions were the administration of any form of NRT including gum,
transdermal patch, nasal spray, oral spray, lozenges, mini lozenges, or oral inhalator over various
periods. Studies using multiple smoking cessation medications were included if they reported factors
associated with only NRT users separately.
Comparator: In studies with a control group, the control was either a placebo, active comparator
group, or no intervention at all.
Outcome: Studies that reported factors associated with adherence to NRT were included.
Study: Both quantitative and qualitative study designs, such as cross-sectional surveys,
case-control studies, longitudinal studies, qualitative studies, mixed-method studies, and clinical trials
with full texts were included in the review. Commentary, abstracts, reviews, and editorial letters were
excluded. There was no restriction regarding geographical locations, year of publication, and language
of publication.
2.2. Literature Searching and Citation Screening
Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) were searched
from the start of indexing to 30 August 2020. Furthermore, each reference list of included studies was
checked and subject-based journals such as Nicotine and Tobacco Research and Journal of Addiction
were searched. Grey literature such as the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Smoking
and Health Resource Library and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence were searched.
Additionally, the first ten pages of free google search were revised for possible eligible articles. The
selected databases and grey literature were searched using words and phrases displayed below. The
search strategy was developed with an experienced librarian (Supplementary Material 1). Citations
collected using Endnote reference management software version 9 (Clarivate, New York, NY, USA) and
exported to Covidence software for screening [29]. Two reviewers (A.M. and D.T.) screened identified
citations by using the above-mentioned inclusion/exclusion criteria.

2.4. Data Extraction
Data extraction for quantitative studies was performed by two reviewers (AM, PE) independently
for each article. Data extraction from qualitative studies were performed using Nvivo 12 software
(QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). Factors associated with adherence to NRT were identified,
coded, and analysed using framework analysis. The data extraction template incorporated information
on the identification of studies, methodological characteristics, and main findings regarding the barriers
and facilitators of adherence to NRT. When there existed a disagreement between reviewers, it was
resolved through discussion and mutual agreement.
2.5. Quality Assessment
The quality of each study was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal
tool [30]. Studies scoring ≥7 out of a maximum score of 10 or ≥70% if the maximum score was not 10
were considered high quality; studies scoring <4 or 40% were considered low-quality studies. Those

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 8895

4 of 21

studies scoring between 4 and 7 (40–70%) were considered to have medium quality. As illustrated
in Table 1, most of the studies included in this systematic review were assessed to have high quality.
All but three studies [31–33] scored over 70% on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal
tool [30]. The most common limitations among randomised control trials were failing to report whether
those delivering treatment and outcome assessors were blind to treatment assignment [16,17,32–41].
Whereas, the most common limitations identified from observational studies were the absence of
objective and standard criterion to measure the condition, which may increase the risk of bias of
studies [8,31,42]. None of the qualitative studies included a statement about the influence of researchers’
culture or belief on the research [43–46]. (Supplementary Material 2).

Cross-sectional,
101

Males or non-pregnant females
between the ages of 18 and 65, who
met DSM-IV criteria for nicotine
dependence and reported at least
one previous failed quit attempt.

Patch adherence was obtained by
counting dispensed and used patches
by the research technician.

Greater dependence was associated with less
patch use, indicating that subjects smoking more
cigarettes were less patch adherent. A positive
relationship between greater motivation and
more patch use was demonstrated.

Adult smokers or recent ex-smokers
who reported having made a quit
attempt in the previous year and
reported using NRT to help them
quit.

Completion of a course of treatment
was defined as use for 8 weeks, with
those who terminated before this cut
point considered to have stopped
prematurely.

Relapse back to smoking was the most common
reason for discontinuation of medication reported
by 41.6% of respondents. Side effects (18.3%) and
believing that the medication was no longer
needed (17.1%) were also commonly reported.

87%

RCT, 269

Adult smokers in the age group of 18
to 65 years old.

Participants were asked whether they
had followed treatment instructions to
use one patch every day over the past
week. Adherence to patch use as
responding “yes” to this question
during at least 5 of the 6 weeks (>80%).

Participants who smoked a greater number of
cigarettes per day at baseline (OR = 0.97; 95% CI
= 0.94–0.99) and had higher withdrawal
symptoms (OR = 0.97; 95% CI= 0.95–0.98) were
less likely to adhere to patch usage.

Pregnant women not using NRT as it
was recommended by the health care
provider.

Four main themes were identified: expectations
of NRT, the experience of using NRT, safety
concerns, and experience of using e-cigarettes.
Low NRT adherence is associated with believing
the risk of smoking and NRT as comparable.

Currently smoked every day or
some days or had quit within 365
days of the interview date, tried to
quit within 365 days of the interview,

NRT usage as prescribed by a health
care provider instruction.

Discontinuing NRT factors were resuming
smoking (34%), side effects (17%), NRT not
helping with quitting (14%), quitting smoking
(10%), and cost (5%).

75%

Adults who smoked at least 10
cigarettes per day, had been smoking
for at least a year.

Based on patch use during the 6 week
treatment period, participants were
categorized as fully adherent (used
“all of the patches”), partially adherent
(used “most or some of the patches”),
or nonadherent (used “a bit or none of
the patches”).

Not dropping out of the study and intensive

Participants were eligible if they
were: (1) seropositive for HIV, (2) 18+
years of age, (3) currently smoking
(≥5 cigarettes/d for the past 3
months).

Adherence was measured using
retrospective self-reports of NRT patch
collected at each follow-up visit.

Greater social support network contact was
associated with higher levels of nicotine patch
adherence.

All participants were prescribed a
nicotine patch and oral NRT dose.

The proportion of all NRT prescribed
consumed each day, averaged over the
4 week treatment period.

Prescribing higher doses of patch and oral NRT
was associated with higher mean daily
consumption of NRT.

RCT, 147

Participants were adult women
living in Ohio on NRT for smoking
cessation.

Patch adherence was dichotomised
into 7 weeks or less versus >7 weeks to
distinguish between participants who
received close to the recommended 8
weeks of patches from those who did
not.

Depressive symptoms and low nicotine
dependence were associated with lower patch
adherence, while the high poverty-to-income
ratio was associated with high responsiveness.

85%

RCT, 623

Participants needed to be willing to
quit smoking in the next 30 days, at
least 18 years old, smoking at least 5
cigarettes per day for the previous 6
months.

Daily patch use was coded as binary (0
= used patches 6 or fewer days in the
past week and 1 = used patches every
day for the past week) and mean daily
mini-lozenge use was coded as an
ordered categorical variable.

Greater baseline dependence predicting greater
medication use. Greater quitting motivation and
confidence and believing that smoking cessation
medication was safe and easy to use were
associated with greater adherence.

77%

Adult current daily smokers who
had smoked at least 10 cigarettes per
day.

The number of nicotine patches used
was assessed at an 8 week follow-up
(end-of-treatment) survey by asking
respondents “how much of the
nicotine patches did you use?”, with
the response options of “none”,
“some”, “all”.

The most common reasons for using only some of
the 5 weeks of nicotine patches were delayed
initiation, side effects, and discontinuation of use
due to stress. Among individuals who have not
used any of the nicotine patches, the most
common reasons were not being ready to quit,
stress, and hesitance to use because of the
misperception of nicotine patch effects or
side-effects.

Main Outcomes on Factors Associated with
Adherence

Quality

Adult current smokers using NRT
for smoking cessation.

Self-reported use of NRT daily for at
least 4 weeks during the first 3 months.

Higher education, the experience of NRT use,
perceiving quitting as more difficult, and
willingness to pay were significant predictors of
adherence.

87%

Pregnant or recently pregnant
women in England and Wales who
gave birth within 6 months.

NRT usage as prescribed by a health
care provider’s instruction during
pregnancy.

NRT adherence was found to be associated with
pregnant women’s preference for quitting
unassisted, unrealistic expectations,
overconfidence, safety concerns, side effects, and
capability to use.

80%

Being currently homeless, smoked at
least 5 cigarettes per day, smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime, and
smoked at least one cigarette every
day.

Adherence was defined as a total score
of zero in a modified Morisky
adherence scale at the end of NRT
treatment (8 weeks).

After adjusting for confounders, smokers who
were depressed at baseline (OR = 0.58, 95% CI,
0.38–0.87, p = 0.01), had lower confidence to quit
(OR = 1.10, 95% CI, 1.01–1.19, p = 0.04), were less
motivated to adhere (OR = 1.04, 95% CI, 1.00–1.07,
p = 0.04), and were less likely to be adherent to
NRT. Further, the age of initial smoking was
positively associated with adherence status (OR =
0.83, 95% CI, 0.69–0.99, p = 0.04).

92%

African American light smokers
(defined as smoking ≤10
cigarettes/day).

Adherence to gum was defined as
using greater than or equal 75% of the
total prescribed gum usage during the
8 weeks of treatment with gum.

Having more quit attempts in the past year (OR=
1.04, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.07), higher baseline
exhaled carbon monoxide (OR = 1.22, 95% CI =
1.01 to 1.48), and higher perceived stress (OR =
1.12, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.22) increased the
likelihood of adherence to nicotine gum.

18 years of age and meet hazardous
drinking criteria as defined by the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism (NIAAA).

NRT use was assessed by self-report at
the 7 month follow-up. Participants
were asked to select which category
best described their level of
medication use: (1) all of it, (2) about
half of it, (3) less than half of it, or (4)
none of it. NRT use was coded as
follows: used all NRT = 1, used some
NRT = 2 (collapsed half and less than
half together), used none = 3.

Those who used all of the NRT had been smoking
for a fewer number of years (22.8 ± 12.8), reported
a lower percentage of heavy drinking days at
baseline (11.6%), and were more likely to
complete the second counselling session (38.4%).

At least 18 years of age, Latino,
HIV-positive, smoked at least 5
cigarettes per day for at least the last
20 days, and had used the nicotine
patch during any past quit attempt.

Consumption of NRT as prescribed by
the health care provider.

Consistent use of the nicotine patch was
associated with maintaining high motivation for
use (i.e., not necessarily motivation to quit, but
motivation to continue patch use); linking its use
with established daily routines (e.g., with taking
other medications, with brushing teeth); and
maintaining realistic expectations for patch
efficacy (e.g., that users may still experience some
level of craving and/or withdrawal).

Adherence to NRT is associated with the presence
of side effects, forgetfulness, or practical
difficulties.

70%

Current daily smokers recruited
from the Penn State Hershey
Medical Centre and surrounding
family medicine outpatient centres.

Adherence to the directed use of the
nicotine patch was measured by the
number of self-reported days, of 28
days, the patch was worn during the
quit attempt in treatment. Participants
were considered adherent if the patch
was worn all 28 days and
non-adherent if the nicotine patch was
worn less than 28 days.

Reasons for non-adherence were forgetting to put
the patch on (30%), not liking the experienced
side effects (15%), resuming smoking (10%), and
difficulty affording the cost of the patches (7%).

2.6. Data Synthesis
Data were extracted and analysed using a framework analysis and factors associated with
adherence to NRT were mapped into the six sub-components of the COM-B Model (psychological
capability, physical capability, social opportunity, physical opportunity, automatic motivation, and
reflective motivation) using a guideline set out by Michie and colleagues [19]. Two reviewers (A.M.
and P.E.) independently mapped the factors and disagreements were resolved through discussion and
mutual understanding. Factors under the six sub-components of the model are discussed separately
below. Included studies are summarised in Table 1 and identified factors illustrated using a framework

female participants [31,35,38,39,41,42,51], and in seven articles, male participants represented a higher
proportion than females [8,33,40,47–50]. Most of the studies defined adherence to medication as using
NRT in accordance with health care provider instructions. Details of the definitions used to assess
adherence to NRT for each study are described in Table 1.
3.2. COM-B Analysis
The COM-B model (capability, opportunity, and motivation), and its sub-components were used
to group factors associated with adherence to NRT among participants who smoke. This systematic
review identified a total of 31 factors (Figure 2) associated with adherence to NRT from 26 studies,
which were mapped onto the six sub-components of the COM-B model (Table 2).

3.3. Psychological Capability
This theme explored the psychological capabilities of participants of the studies to adhere to NRT.
Adherence to NRT was found to be associated with the level of education [8]. Completing grade 12 or
above was found to be significantly associated with a greater level of adherence to NRT in a study
conducted among Chinese current smokers (OR = 2.29, 95% CI of 1.14 to 4.62) [8]. In addition, past
experience of using any type of NRT was associated with an improved level of adherence with NRT
use instructions provided by the health care provider (Figure 2) [8,45].
Forgetfulness was a significant factor affecting participants’ adherence to taking NRT medication.
A study conducted among adolescents in the Netherlands secondary school students reported
forgetting to take NRT (38%) as one of the main reasons for non-adherence to NRT. [39] Similarly,
30% of the participants in a study conducted in the U.S documented forgetfulness as a reason for
non-adherence to physician instructions. [51] Similarly, a qualitative study conducted in the U.S. among
HIV positive individuals reported trouble remembering to use the nicotine patches as one of the factors
affecting adherence [43].
One of the interviewees said, “I’m currently couch surfing . . . I try to keep the box of patches [nicotine
patches] in my suitcase but sometimes I forget.” [43]
Participants of the study also suggested putting the nicotine patch with other medications or their
toothbrush and keeping it in a more visible place as a strategy to avoid forgetfulness [43].
Another participant said, “I put it where, you know, like the deodorant and the perfumes and the
colognes are, which is what I do in some of the medications that I take and they’re right here and I’m
going to make sure that I put it on. But that’s how I remember things.” [43]
Moreover, participants who had a high level of confidence about quitting were found to adhere to
NRT better than participants who did not have confidence in themselves [41,48]. However, results of a
qualitative study conducted among pregnant women suggested overconfidence in one’s ability to quit
without assistance, usually accompanied by a negative belief towards the medication, which can lead
to poor adherence to NRT [46].
3.4. Physical Capability
This category assessed participants’ physical capability to adhere to NRT. The association between
nicotine dependence and adherence is inconsistent, some studies show an inverse relation [31,37,47],
while others show a direct relation [16,17,32,42]. Most of the studies used the Fagerstrom test of
nicotine dependence (FTND) except one study that used the number of cigarettes per day as a measure
of nicotine dependence [37]. The FTND is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of nicotine
addiction. The scale contains six items such as the number of cigarettes per day, difficulty in refraining
from smoking in forbidden places, and others. The higher the score the more intense is the nicotine
dependence. Scores above 6 indicate a high level of nicotine dependence [10].
Four of the studies included in this systematic review found a higher level of adherence among
participants with strong nicotine dependence [16,17,32,42]. Exhaled carbon monoxide is also an
indicator of the number of cigarettes one smokes. Higher baseline exhaled carbon monoxide among
African Americans was shown to be associated with improved adherence to NRT (OR = 1.22,
95% CI = 1.01 to 1.48) [16].
On the contrary, three studies found an inverse relationship between stronger nicotine dependence
and participants’ adherence to NRT [31,37,47]. It was found that people with higher scores of FTND
have a lower level of adherence to nicotine patches [31]. For instance, the outcome of a study conducted
in Syria, using data from a double-blind randomised trial among adult smokers, concluded that higher
FTND scores and a higher number of cigarettes smoked per day were predictors of low adherence to
nicotine patches [47]. Higher baseline saliva cotinine level was inversely associated with adherence

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 8895

13 of 21

to NRT [37]. Cotinine is the principal metabolite product produced by the liver when a person
smokes tobacco. It easily diffuses from the bloodstream to saliva and is used to estimate the blood
cotinine level [52].
Relapse was usually associated with a higher level of nicotine dependence and shown to have an
inverse relationship with adherence to NRT [31]. Relapse was found to be one of the most common
reasons (10–56% of participants) for premature discontinuation of NRT [15,38,39,51].
The number of years of smoking may be a factor to consider, as it might affect nicotine dependence.
Similar to the level of dependence, there are controversies regarding the duration of smoking and
its association with adherence to NRT [38,41]. For example, American homeless smokers were more
likely to adhere to NRT if they had started smoking at a younger age [48]. However, in another setting,
having fewer years of smoking was associated with a higher level of adherence to NRT [49].
Participants who experienced greater levels of withdrawal symptoms had lower adherence to
NRT [18,47]. Strategies used to reduce the extent of withdrawal symptoms were associated with
improved adherence to NRT. For instance, pregnant women who started NRT within 48 h of quitting
were found to be five-fold more adherent to their medication than those who started after 48 h (OR = 5.4,
95% CI = 2.2–12.9) [34]. A secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial showed
that prescribing higher doses of nicotine patches instead of lower dose nicotine patches improves
adherence rates [36].
NRT may have side effects such as skin irritation, hiccups, loss of appetite, nausea, unpleasant
mouth taste, insomnia, irritability, sore throat, and increased blood pressure. Premature discontinuation
of NRT due to experiencing side effects was another physical capability factor found to be associated
with NRT adherence [15,18,38,39,42,44,51]. The rate of non-adherence due to side effects to the NRT
regimen ranged from 15 to 17% in a study conducted in the U.S. [15,51]; from 11 to 19.3% in a study
conducted in the Netherlands [18,39], and 14% in a study in Canada [38]. In the reviewed publications,
skin irritations were among the factors that led to non-adherence to NRT use (Figure 2) [44,45].
One participant said, “Regardless of where I put it . . . my skin was still itching through the patch, so
I’d scratch right on the patch.” [44]
In addition, the taste of oral NRT can be a factor for non-adherence, which is illustrated in a
qualitative study.
One consumer using oral NRT said, “Yeah, totally delayed cos I keep saying ‘oh I don’t want to taste
it yet, I’ll give it another ten minutes you know, or I’ll give it a bit longer’. It is delaying it cos you
think I’m not looking forward to the taste of it so I’ll just wait a bit longer.” [45]
In addition, among pregnant women, increased intensity of morning sickness was a deterrent to
adherence to NRT. [45]
A pregnant woman said, “I was just more worried about the side effects obviously because I’m quite
early on in pregnancy, and especially with morning sickness anyway, I didn’t know that it [NRT]
would cause—obviously [it] made me feel more nauseous and [I] vomited quite a few times when I had
the gum. So just would have been nice to have a heads up about it that it makes you feel sick”. [45]
3.5. Motivation
Studies consistently reflected the direct relationship between the level of motivation to quit smoking
and adherence to NRT [31,41,43,44,48]. When attempting to quit cigarette smoking, motivation affects
an individual’s decision making and goal setting. Having a low level of motivation to use NRT as well
as not being ready to quit smoking reduced the level of adherence [41,48]. Motivated participants are
more likely to have the energy to take the NRT as prescribed. For instance, in one study, the rate of
adherence was found to be 57.2% among motivated participants and 37.1% among individuals with
less level of motivation to quit smoking [41]. Moreover, participants of qualitative study demonstrated
how motivation affects adherence (Figure 2) [43].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 8895

14 of 21

One participant said, “ . . . I know it’s helping me out. I haven’t missed a dose because I’m
motivated.”[43]
Motivation has two sub-components: Reflective motivation encompasses individuals’ conscious
decision, plan, and evaluation of the problem and the NRT. Whereas, automatic motivation includes
impulses, emotions, habits, and desire to see positive health or other outcomes [20]
3.6. Reflective Motivation
The reflective motivation category includes factors that affect an individual’s evaluation of NRT
and quitting, planning, and conscious decision-making processes. Adherence to NRT was found to
be poor among participants who believed NRT has no effect in supporting one’s quit attempt. For
example, in a study conducted in the Netherlands, more than one-third of adolescents believed NRT
had no effect and discontinued the treatment prematurely [39]. Similarly, 14% of adult participants
in a study conducted in the U.S. discontinued NRT because they believed it was not helpful [15].
Additionally, throughout the treatment process mistakenly assuming that NRT was no longer necessary
was a driver of poor adherence. A large multi-national survey from four countries (Australia, Canada,
USA, and UK) found that 16.3% of participants discontinued the medication prematurely because they
believed it was no longer needed [42].
Concern about the safety of NRT was one of the main factors affecting participants’ reflective
motivation to use the medication. Participants who believed NRT was not safe tended to discontinue
the medication prematurely or utilised lower doses of NRT than the recommended dose [50]. Thus,
hesitancy to use NRT due to belief about safety and efficacy was associated with poor adherence [38].
Some participants also believed that taking NRT may increase their addiction to cigarettes [45].
One person stated that, “Well, all they keep saying is you know it gets rid of the toxins, you still get
the nicotine but it gets rid of the toxins, this, that and the other and it’s just in that the nicotine you
take it in. The nicotine itself is what makes it addictive, so to me the more nicotine that you’re taking in
any way, the more you’re going to want to smoke or you know you’re going to need that nicotine.”[45]
The perception of smokers and ex-smokers that following health care providers’ instructions was
an easy task was associated with better adherence to NRT [41].
When individuals failed in their attempt to quit smoking several times, it was associated with a
decreased motivation for further attempts. It has been shown that the higher the number of previous
quit attempts, the lower adherence to NRT and vice versa (Figure 2) [16,34].
3.7. Automatic Motivation
This category includes factors that affect adherence to NRT by influencing an individual’s
emotions, impulses, and unconscious associations with the performance of the desired behaviour, e.g.,
daily routines.
In this automatic category, one of the main factors affecting adherence to NRT was found to be
the mental health status of the individual. Participants who were not diagnosed with depression had
more than double the level of adherence to NRT compared with participants who were diagnosed with
depression (OR = 2.48, 95% CI, 1.14 to 5.39) [17]. Similarly, a study among homeless smokers showed a
lower level of adherence among participants with depressive symptoms [48].
Individuals who were experiencing a higher level of stress had a lower level of adherence to
NRT [38]. However, awareness of stress during a quit attempt increased the odds of being adherent to
NRT [16]. Similarly, individuals with an anxiety disorder were found to be less adherent than those
without anxiety symptoms [35].
Alcohol consumption was associated with an increased level of smoking. It was shown that
individuals with alcohol dependence problems found adhering to NRT challenging [49].
In addition to this, fearing dependence to NRT [18] and being able to incorporate the habit of
using the medication with daily routines impinge on adherence to NRT [43]. Linking NRT use with

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 8895

15 of 21

other daily routine activities seemed to improve the level of adherence. Being part of the daily routine
motivates participants in adhering to NRT (Figure 2) [43].
A participant said, “It’s a routine. I put it on after I shower in the morning and put the patches next
to my medication.”[43]
Similarly, HIV-positive Latino participants in a qualitative study illustrated how they associated
taking the NRT with their other medications [44].
Another interviewee stated, “I leave it [the patches] next to my medication and remember to take it at
the same time each day.”[44]
3.8. Physical Opportunity
This subcomponent describes how the physical environment affects an individual’s level of
adherence to NRT (Figure 2). The cost of NRT was the main environmental factor that was associated
with the level of adherence to NRT, since it affected an individual’s motivation to take NRT as prescribed
by the health care provider. For instance, data from the Colorado state tobacco survey demonstrated
that 5% of participants discontinued the NRT because they could not afford the cost. Moreover,
participants who discontinued the treatment due to cost issues had less intention to use NRT in a
future quit attempt. [15] Likewise, 7% of participants in a study conducted in the U.S. discontinued the
nicotine patch due to cost-related issues [51].
Although NRT is an over-the-counter product approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in the U.S., its price may be prohibitively high for most minors, thus discouraging effective use
of NRT [53].
It is suggested that factors such as gender and age have an association with adherence to NRT.
Being a male and of older age was associated with better adherence to NRT [8,33,35,49]. For instance,
one study showed that males are more than twice as likely to be adherent than females (OR = 2.38,
95% CI, 1.25 to 4.55) [8]. The same study illustrated that older age is associated with a greater level of
adherence to NRT (OR = 2.45, 95% CI, 1.29 to 4.64) [8].
3.9. Social Opportunity
This component of the model consists of factors outside of the individual that makes the
performance of the behaviour possible. Having a better social network and support affects adherence
to NRT both directly and indirectly through influencing one’s motivation to quit smoking (Figure 2).
A randomised trial conducted among HIV-positive smokers in the U.S. evaluated the effect of social
support on adherence to NRT. The study utilised a modified version of the Important People and
Activities Instrument. The findings indicated that having greater social support network contact
is significantly associated with a higher level of adherence to nicotine patch [40]. On the contrary,
one study reported a lower level of adherence to NRT among participants who lived with a child
or children. Living with a child or children may lead to forgetting to take the NRT and increased
psychological stress due to the responsibility it brings to the individual [35].
4. Discussion
This review identifies factors using a predefined behavioural model, the COM-B model, which is
at the hub of the BCW that was effectively used to design and implement behavioural change strategies.
Hence, the intervention functions and policy categories in the BCW are used to recommend and
discussed the findings [54].
Strategies that aimed at addressing intervention functions of the BCW such as enablement,
education, and training were found to be effective in improving psychological capability of an
individual towards adherence to smoking cessation medications [19,55]. For instance, a double-blind
randomised controlled trial conducted in the UK evaluated the effect of a mobile application (NRT2Quit)

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 8895

16 of 21

among adult smokers. The application provided comprehensive information about quitting and NRT,
daily tips as well as a reminder about the medications. The intervention group had a higher level of
treatment adherence and 4 weeks biochemically verified smoking cessation rate (25%) compared to the
control group (8%). This study supports our findings on the importance of an individual’s ability to
remember and comprehend the necessary information and instructions about NRT use [56].
In this review, except for the level of nicotine dependence, all other factors mapped under physical
capability were consistently associated with either high or low level of adherence to NRT. Studies that
reported an inverse relationship between the level of dependence and adherence to NRT also reported
relapse to smoking and dropout from the study, which may have contributed to the inverse relationship
between the two variables [31]. Prescribing higher doses of NRT and early initiation were found to
improve the level of adherence to NRT [36]. This can be explained by the fact that higher doses are
more effective in alleviating withdrawal symptoms from quitting than low dose preparations leading
to better adherence. This is represented as enablement in the intervention function and guideline in
the policy category of the BCW [54].
Furthermore, withdrawal symptoms were one of the most commonly reported causes for
nonadherence in the category of physical capability. When attempting to quit smoking, experiencing
greater levels of withdrawal symptoms could become a barrier to abstinence, which also applies to
NRT aided smoking cessation [57]. This explains why, when participants attempt to quit smoking “cold
turkey” (unaided) or delay initiation of NRT, they often fail to quit or adhere to NRT [38]. To minimise
withdrawal symptoms, the dose of NRT should be adjusted according to one’s dependence and severity
of withdrawal symptoms [58,59].
Medication-related beliefs and expectations were the main factors categorised under the reflective
motivation subcomponent of the COM-B model. A randomised factorial study also found a significant
positive effect of additional medication-related face-to-face counselling and automated phone calls
directed to improve knowledge about NRT [60]. Establishing realistic expectations are also vital during
quit attempt. A study conducted by Tucker et al. in 2017 [61] reported a higher adherence rate to NRT
among participants who received additional information on the extent of withdrawal symptoms and
urges and how NRT would reduce them in order to develop realistic expectations.
Motivation improves once ability to cope up with withdrawal symptoms and improves the
appropriate consumption of NRT [62]. Psychological symptoms and alcohol use reduced the rate of
motivation to quit and adherence to NRT. This could be explained by the risk of resuming smoking
among participants who have developed the above mental issues [62,63]. There is a close link between
smoking and drinking. Alcohol intake may trigger cravings to smoke cigarettes [64]. Alcohol may affect
adherence to NRT by increasing the risk of resuming smoking [65]. As alcohol intake is often cited as a
major precipitant of smoking relapse [66], current clinical guidelines for smoking cessation also suggest
reducing or avoiding drinking during quit attempt [67]. The rewarding effect of smoking is enhanced in
smokers with alcoholic disorders. Hence, smokers with alcohol use disorders tend to experience intense
withdrawal symptoms and craving leading to resuming smoking and medication nonadherence [68].
The rate of adherence to NRT was improved among clinical trial participants for whom associating
medication with regular activities such as taking other medications, with meals, and watching preferred
TV shows were achieved with the help of therapists [69]. Being able to identify and prevent personal
triggers reduces the risk of relapse and adherence to NRT. This finding is similar with a randomised
trial that aimed at identifying and avoiding temptations to smoke, which helped improve adherence at
eight weeks as well as self-reported abstinence rates [61].
Factors categorised under opportunity component of the COM-B model can be improved by
addressing the fiscal measures and legislation elements in the BCW that advocate access to NRT [54].
Although most countries subsidise the cost of NRT and provide the medication over the counter, it may
still be difficult to get a preferred or combination of forms of NRT. NRT may only be prescribed for a
shorter period, which may not be enough to support cessation leading to premature discontinuation of
NRT [70]. Greater social support increases adherence to nicotine patches, which may be explained

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 8895

17 of 21

by the effect of having someone to remind the participant to take the medications, motivate them to
stay quit, and provide financial support to refill medications [71]. Additionally, having greater social
support may improve the mental health status of an individual during a quit attempt [72].
4.1. Strength and Limitations of the Study
Our search strategy was broad and comprehensive and was developed with the help of an
experienced librarian. As only one study was conducted in a developing country, caution should
be taken during interpreting the findings especially in developing countries; there were also some
inconsistencies in the direction of the association between some factors. Moreover, the COM-B
model did not distinguish intentional and unintentional nonadherence. Despite these limitations,
this systematic review is the first to evaluate enablers and facilitators of adherence to NRT using the
theoretical framework of the COM-B model.
4.2. Implications for Policy, Research, and Practice
Health care providers are recommended to provide adequate information about withdrawal
symptoms and NRT, address safety concerns, and establish realistic expectations. Individuals are
recommended to boost their motivation and mental health by having social connections, physical
activity, and managing stress. It is also recommended for patients to visit health care providers,
smoking cessation support services, or access a Quitline for psychological support and counselling.
Subsidisation of smoking cessation medications and care are advocated and recommended to
improve adherence to NRT and the success of smoking cessation attempts. It is recommended to
advocate policies and strategies that can enhance motivation to quit smoking through the promotion
of the health benefits of smoking cessation and smoking cessation supports.
Additionally, as the review illustrated the importance of factors at multiple levels, implementation
and evaluations of trials addressing multiple components of the COM-B level are recommended.
More studies, especially among special population groups, such as pregnant women, individuals
with psychiatric disorders, and socially disadvantaged individuals, are recommended to develop more
tailored approaches. In addition, as gender is an important factor for adherence and successful quitting,
future research should include gender-based analysis.
5. Conclusions
The current review demonstrated the importance of personal, social, and environmental factors
affecting adherence to NRT using a comprehensive predefined theoretical framework (COM-B model).
Most of the identified factors were mapped under the category of the reflective motivation component
of the COM-B model followed by physical capability, and automatic motivation. Hence, reflective
motivation is the most crucial element for adherence to NRT out of the six sub-components of the
COM-B model. However, it should be noted that all sub-components of the COM-B model are essential
in moderating an individual’s behaviour concerning adherence to NRT. For instance, motivation cannot
provide opportunity, and if these are missing, then according to the COM-B model, behaviours have to
be engaged with to increase or seek out opportunities, which may be beyond an individual’s control.

ABSTRACT
Background
Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help people to stop smoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to
counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). This is an update of
a Cochrane Review first published in 2007.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register in April 2022 for trials, using relevant terms in the title or
abstract, or as keywords. The register is compiled from searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared the treatment drug with placebo, another smoking cessation drug, e-cigarettes,
or no medication. We excluded trials that did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from baseline.
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods. Our main outcome was abstinence from smoking at longest follow-up using the most rigorous
definition of abstinence, preferring biochemically validated rates where reported. We pooled risk ratios (RRs), using the Mantel-Haenszel
fixed-effect model. We also reported the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs).
Main results
We included 75 trials of 45,049 people; 45 were new for this update. We rated 22 at low risk of bias, 18 at high risk, and 35 at unclear risk.
We found moderate-certainty evidence (limited by heterogeneity) that cytisine helps more people to quit smoking than placebo (RR 1.30,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.47; I2 = 83%; 4 studies, 4623 participants), and no evidence of a difference in the number reporting
SAEs (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 3781 participants; low-certainty evidence). SAE evidence was limited by imprecision.
We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac SAEs.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We found high-certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.51; I2 = 60%, 41 studies,
17,395 participants), and moderate-certainty evidence that people taking varenicline are more likely to report SAEs than those not taking
it (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.48; I2 = 0%; 26 studies, 14,356 participants). While point estimates suggested increased risk of cardiac SAEs (RR
1.20, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.84; I2 = 0%; 18 studies, 7151 participants; low-certainty evidence), and decreased risk of neuropsychiatric SAEs (RR
0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.29; I2 = 0%; 22 studies, 7846 participants; low-certainty evidence), in both cases evidence was limited by imprecision,
and confidence intervals were compatible with both benefit and harm.
Pooled results from studies that randomised people to receive cytisine or varenicline showed that more people in the varenicline arm
quit smoking (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 2131 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and reported SAEs (RR 0.67,
95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; I2 = 45%; 2 studies, 2017 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, the evidence was limited by imprecision, and
confidence intervals incorporated the potential for benefit from either cytisine or varenicline. We found no data on neuropsychiatric or
cardiac SAEs.
We found high-certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than bupropion (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.49; I2 = 0%; 9 studies,
7560 participants), and no clear evidence of difference in rates of SAEs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 5317 participants),
neuropsychiatric SAEs (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.04; I2 = 10%; 2 studies, 866 participants), or cardiac SAEs (RR 3.17, 95% CI 0.33 to 30.18; I2
= 0%; 2 studies, 866 participants). Evidence of harms was of low certainty, limited by imprecision.
We found high-certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than a single form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (RR
1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.37; I2 = 28%; 11 studies, 7572 participants), and low-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, of fewer reported
SAEs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; I2 = 24%; 6 studies, 6535 participants). We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac SAEs.
We found no clear evidence of a difference in quit rates between varenicline and dual-form NRT (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; I2 =
0%; 5 studies, 2344 participants; low-certainty evidence, downgraded because of imprecision). While pooled point estimates suggested
increased risk of SAEs (RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.49 to 9.46; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1852 participants) and neuropsychiatric SAEs (RR 4.69, 95% CI 0.23
to 96.50; I2 not estimable as events only in 1 study; 2 studies, 764 participants), and reduced risk of cardiac SAEs (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to
7.88; I2 not estimable as events only in 1 study; 2 studies, 819 participants), in all three cases evidence was of low certainty and confidence
intervals were very wide, encompassing both substantial harm and benefit.
Authors' conclusions
Cytisine and varenicline both help more people to quit smoking than placebo or no medication. Varenicline is more effective at helping
people to quit smoking than bupropion, or a single form of NRT, and may be as or more effective than dual-form NRT. People taking
varenicline are probably more likely to experience SAEs than those not taking it, and while there may be increased risk of cardiac SAEs
and decreased risk of neuropsychiatric SAEs, evidence was compatible with both benefit and harm. Cytisine may lead to fewer people
reporting SAEs than varenicline. Based on studies that directly compared cytisine and varenicline, there may be a benefit from varenicline
for quitting smoking, however further evidence could strengthen this finding or demonstrate a benefit from cytisine.
Future trials should test the effectiveness and safety of cytisine compared with varenicline and other pharmacotherapies, and should also
test variations in dose and duration. There is limited benefit to be gained from more trials testing the effect of standard-dose varenicline
compared with placebo for smoking cessation. Further trials on varenicline should test variations in dose and duration, and compare
varenicline with e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
Can medications like varenicline and cytisine (nicotine receptor partial agonists) help people to stop smoking and do they cause
unwanted effects?
Key messages
· Varenicline can help people to stop smoking for at least 6 months. Evidence shows it works better than bupropion and using only one
type of nicotine replacement therapy (e.g. only patches). Quit rates might be similar to using more than one type of nicotine replacement
therapy at the same time (e.g. patches and gum together).
· Cytisine can help people to stop smoking for at least 6 months. It may work as well as varenicline, but future evidence may show that
while it helps, it is not quite as helpful as varenicline.
· Future studies should test the effectiveness and safety of cytisine compared with varenicline and other stop-smoking medications, and
should also investigate giving cytisine or varenicline at different doses and for different lengths of time.
What are 'nicotine receptor partial agonists'?
Smoking tobacco is extremely bad for people’s health. For people who smoke, quitting is the best thing they can do to improve their health.
Many people find it difficult to quit smoking. Nicotine receptor partial agonists (NRPAs) are a type of medication used to help people to

stop smoking. They help to reduce the withdrawal symptoms people experience when they stop smoking, like cravings and unpleasant
mood changes. They also reduce the pleasure people usually experience when they smoke. The most widely-available treatment in this
drug type is varenicline. Cytisine is another, similar medication. They may cause unwanted effects such as feeling sick (nausea) and other
stomach problems, difficulties sleeping, abnormal dreams, and headache. They may also lead to potentially serious unwanted effects,
such as suicidal thoughts, heart problems and raised blood pressure.
What did we want to find out?
We wanted to find out if using NRPAs can help people to quit smoking, and if they cause unwanted effects. We wanted to know:
· how many people stopped smoking for at least 6 months; and
· how many people had unwanted effects.
What did we do?
We searched for studies that investigated NRPAs used to help people quit smoking. People in the studies had to be chosen at random to
receive an NRPA, or another NRPA, placebo (medication like the NRPA but with no active ingredients) or no treatment. They had to be adult
tobacco smokers who wanted to stop smoking.
What did we find?
We found 75 studies that compared NRPAs with:
· placebo or no medicine;
· nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches or gum;
· bupropion (another medicine to help people stop smoking);
· another NRPA;
· e-cigarettes.
The USA hosted the most studies (28 studies). Other studies took place in a range of countries across the world, some in several countries.
Main results
People are more likely to stop smoking for at least six months using varenicline than using placebo (41 studies, 17,395 people), bupropion
(9 studies, 7560 people), or just one type of nicotine replacement therapy, like patches alone (11 studies, 7572 people). They may be just as
likely to quit as people using two or more kinds of nicotine replacement therapy, like patches and gum together (5 studies, 2344 people).
Cytisine probably helps more people to stop smoking than placebo (4 studies, 4623 people) and based on studies that compared cytisine
with varenicline (2 studies, 2131 people), there may be a benefit from varenicline for quitting smoking, however further evidence could
strengthen this finding or show a benefit from cytisine.
For every 100 people using varenicline to stop smoking, 21 to 25 might successfully stop, compared with only 18 of 100 people using
bupropion, 18 of 100 people using a single form of nicotine-replacement therapy, and 20 of 100 using two or more kinds of nicotinereplacement therapy. For every 100 people using cytisine to stop smoking, 18 to 23 might successfully stop.
The most common unwanted effect of varenicline is nausea, but this is mostly at mild or moderate levels and usually clears over time.
People taking varenicline likely have an increased chance of a more serious unwanted effect that could result in going to hospital, however
these are still rare (2.7% to 4% of people on varenicline, compared with 2.7% of people without) and may include many that are unrelated
to varenicline. People taking cytisine may also have a slightly increased chance of serious unwanted effects compared with people not
taking it, but this may be less likely compared with varenicline.
What are the limitations of the evidence?
The evidence for some of our results is very reliable. We’re very confident that varenicline helps people to quit smoking better than many
alternatives. We’re less sure of some other results because fewer or smaller studies provided evidence.
Several results suggest one treatment is better or less harmful than another, but the opposite could still be true.
How up to date is the evidence?
The evidence is up to date to 29 April 2022.

BACKGROUND

Why it is important to do this review

Description of the condition

The scale of the impact on health from tobacco worldwide makes
it imperative that we continue to develop our understanding
of smoking cessation interventions. While the effectiveness of
varenicline for smoking cessation is well established, substantial
questions remain about different doses and durations of treatment,
and what impact they have on how effective varenicline is at
helping people to quit smoking.

Smoking is the main preventable cause of morbidity and premature
death worldwide, killing more than 8 million people each year
(WHO 2022). It is also a leading cause of health inequalities
(ASH 2019). Quitting tobacco smoking significantly reduces risk
of tobacco-related disease and death (USDHHS 2020). There are
a range of interventions available to help people quit smoking,
including different kinds of behavioural and pharmacological
support, but even with the most effective interventions, long-term
quit rates remain relatively low (Livingstone-Banks 2022a; Rigotti
2022).

Description of the intervention and how it might work
Nicotine receptor partial agonists are a family of drugs that
aim to mitigate the addictiveness of tobacco by binding to the
α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (the receptor that mediates
nicotine dependence through released dopamine). When bound
to the receptor, a partial agonist prompts the receptor to release
dopamine in the way nicotine would, and prevents nicotine
from tobacco from binding to the receptor. This reduces nicotine
withdrawal symptoms and reduces the rewarding effects of
tobacco. There are two main nicotine receptor partial agonists:
varenicline and cytisine. A third drug, dianicline, was developed
but unfavourable results led to its withdrawal from further
development (Kirchhoff 2009).
Varenicline was developed by Pfizer Inc in 1997 (Coe 2005), and
was approved as a prescription-only aid to smoking cessation in
2006 by the American Food and Drug Administration under the
trade name Chantix, and by the European Medicines Evaluation
Agency under the trade name Champix. In July 2007 it was
approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (NICE) for prescribing by the UK National Health Service
(ASH 2006; NICE 2007). In 2021, the World Health Organization
added varenicline to its Essential Medicines List (WHO 2021).
Post-marketing surveillance raised subsequent concerns about
possible links between varenicline and major health risks, including
suicidal ideation and behaviour, depression, and serious adverse
cardiovascular events (FDA 2008), which led to an FDA warning
label in 2009. This warning was removed in 2016 after a large
trial found no evidence to support the concerns (EAGLES 2016). In
2021, Pfizer announced a recall of varenicline because it exceeded
acceptable intake limits of a nitrosamine impurity, called N-nitrosovarenicline. While this is believed to only be temporary, it has led to
shortages at the time of writing.
Cytisine was developed in Bulgaria in the 1960s, and is less widely
available than varenicline (Foulds 2004; Tutka 2005; Tutka 2006).
Its original manufacturer, Sopharma Pharmaceuticals, developed
their phytoproduct from the plant Cytisus Laburnum L. (Golden
Rain). Although cytisine is not licensed and available for use as
a smoking cessation aid across most countries outside Eastern
Europe, it works by the same mechanism as varenicline and it
is available for substantially less cost (Tutka 2019; Gotti 2021).
An important difference between the treatments is that standard
treatment with cytisine lasts 25 days, compared with 12 weeks for
varenicline.

Varenicline is a front-line smoking cessation medication in many
countries, and its current shortage poses a substantial challenge
for tobacco control strategies around the world. Learning more
about how effective and safe cytisine is for smoking cessation may
inform decisions about whether to licence it in countries that have
historically relied on varenicline.
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007, and
most recently updated in 2016. The previous update found highcertainty evidence of a benefit from varenicline, but only included
a limited number of studies testing cytisine for smoking cessation
(Cahill 2016). New evidence comparing cytisine with placebo and
with varenicline warranted an update of this review.

OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness of nicotine receptor partial agonists,
including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation.

METHODS
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clusterRCTs. We did not include quasi-randomised studies, in which the
allocation sequence is not truly random, for example, studies where
participant date of birth determines participant allocation.
Types of participants
We included studies that recruited adult tobacco smokers. Studies
testing nicotine receptor partial agonists to help smokeless tobacco
users to quit, or as a relapse prevention intervention among people
who are already abstinent from smoking tobacco, are covered
in separate Cochrane Reviews (Ebbert 2011a; Livingstone-Banks
2019; Livingstone-Banks 2022b).
Types of interventions
Selective nicotine receptor partial agonists, including cytisine,
dianicline and varenicline (or any other in this class of drug
as they reach Phase 3 trial stage), compared with placebo,
no medication, or another smoking cessation pharmacotherapy
(including nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, electronic
cigarettes, and other nicotine receptor partial agonists). We also
included studies that compared different doses and regimes of
eligible treatments. Lobeline is covered in an earlier Cochrane
Review (Stead 2003). We only included studies that tested the effect
of nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation and not
studies focused on harm reduction, which is covered in a separate
Cochrane Review (Lindson-Hawley 2016).

Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Abstinence from smoked tobacco at longest follow-up, at
least six months from study baseline. We used the strictest
definition of abstinence reported in each study (e.g. prolonged
or continuous over point prevalence), and where available, we
favoured biochemically validated over self-reported abstinence.
We only included studies that measured abstinence from
tobacco smoking at six months or longer from baseline.
• Number of participants who experienced the following
adverse events: nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams, headache,
depression, and suicidal ideation
• Number of participants who experienced serious adverse events
as defined by the authors of included studies
• Number of participants who experienced neuropsychiatric
serious adverse events
• Number of participants who experienced cardiac serious
adverse events.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised
Register for studies, using relevant terms (e.g. 'cytisine' or 'Tabex'
or 'dianicline' or 'varenicline' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist')
in the title or abstract, or as keywords. This Register has been
developed from electronic searching of the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and
PsycINFO, together with handsearching of specialist journals,
conference proceedings and reference lists of previous trials and
overviews. The most recent search of the Register was on 29 April
2022, and included reports of trials indexed in CENTRAL, 2022, Issue
3; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20220405; Embase (via OVID) to
week 202214; PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20220404, all from
inception. See the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Website for
details of the search strategies for these databases. The search
strategy for this specific review is listed in Appendix 1. We did
not place any limits on our searches (e.g. by language, year of
publication, or publication format).
Searching other resources
Our search of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised
Register also covered ongoing and unpublished trials included in
the following databases, as these are indexed in CENTRAL.
• US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials
Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov, searched via
CENTRAL); and
• World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch, searched via
CENTRAL).
We also checked the reference lists of included studies for
potentially eligible trials.

Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
For this update we screened the search results in two stages
using the software Covidence. Two review authors (of JL-B, AT,

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

AH and NL) independently screened the title and abstract of each
study found in our searches. We then reviewed the full text of all
potentially eligible reports in duplicate. At each stage, we resolved
any disagreement through discussion and if needed by referring to
a third review author. We noted the reasons for study exclusion at
full-text stage for our PRISMA diagram illustrating the flow of studies
(Liberati 2009).
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (of JL-B, AT, AH, LH, TRF, and KT) independently
extracted the following information about each included study in
duplicate, using a prepiloted data extraction form. We resolved
disagreement through discussion and if needed by referring to a
third review author.
• Country and setting (e.g. primary care, community, hospital
outpatient/inpatient)
• Method of recruiting participants
• Definition of smoker used
• Methods of randomisation and allocation, and blinding of study
personnel, participants and assessors
• Demographic characteristics of participants (e.g. average age,
sex, average cigarettes per day)
• Intervention and control description (dose, provider, duration,
number of visits, etc.)
• Outcomes including definition of abstinence used, and
biochemical validation of cessation
• Proportion of participants with follow-up data
• Any adverse events
• Declarations of interest and sources of study funding
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed each included study using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool for
the following domains of risk (Higgins 2011).
• Random sequence generation (selection bias)
• Allocation concealment (selection bias)
• Blinding of participants and study personnel and blinding/
objectivity of outcome assessment (performance bias and
detection bias)
• Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
• Selective reporting (reporting bias)
• Other potential risks of bias. For this domain, we assessed and
reported any forms of bias present in studies that did not fall
under one of the above domains. Where no relevant form of
other potential bias was found, we left this field blank.
Two review authors (of JL-B, AT, AH, LH, TRF, and KT) independently
judged each study as at low, unclear, or high risk of bias for
each domain, justifying judgements using information from the
study report. We resolved disagreements in judgements through
discussion and by referral to a third review author where needed.
Measures of treatment effect
We present estimates of effects for individual studies using risk
ratios (RRs), calculated as ((number of events in intervention
condition/intervention denominator)/(number of events in control
condition/control denominator)), with a 95% confidence interval
(CI). An RR greater than one indicates a higher rate of outcome

(either smoking abstinence or adverse events) in the intervention
group than in the control group.
Unit of analysis issues
As cluster-randomised trials are eligible for inclusion in this
review, there is the potential for unit of analysis issues. Where
required, we adjusted for clustering using an intraclass correlation,
either from the study in question or from a similar study. Where
studies compared more than one eligible intervention arm with
a non-intervention control, we either pooled intervention arms
together (assuming they did not differ in pharmacotherapy given)
or added them separately to the meta-analysis and split the control
group data evenly between them, to avoid double-counting any
participants in the analysis.
Dealing with missing data
We conducted our analyses on an intention-to-treat basis,
including all participants in the study arms to which they were
randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention.
We counted participants lost to follow-up as continuing smoking,
which is standard in the field (West 2005). Where study reports
lacked the information needed for our analyses, we tried to contact
study authors to ask for this information. Attempts to contact
study authors are recorded in the Characteristics of included
studies tables.
Assessment of heterogeneity
To investigate heterogeneity, we used the I2 statistic, given by the
formula [(Q - df)/Q] × 100%, where Q is the Chi2 statistic and df is its
degrees of freedom (Higgins 2003). This describes the percentage
of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather
than to sampling error (chance). We interpreted the I2 result using
the following overlapping bands (Deeks 2022):
•
•
•
•

0% to 40%: might not be important
30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity
50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity
75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity

Where we found moderate to substantial heterogeneity, we
investigated further using subgroup analyses based on study
characteristics decided upon through review author consensus. In
the event of considerable unexplained statistical heterogeneity (i.e.
I2 =75% or over), we evaluated whether it was still appropriate to
report a pooled result (Deeks 2022).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

dose or regime, we conducted meta-analyses to pool data from
sufficiently similar studies using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect
model to calculate pooled RRs with 95% CIs.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where studies compared an intervention pharmacotherapy with
either placebo or no medication and there was substantial
heterogeneity, we considered subgrouping analyses based on
comparator and using the I2 statistic to test for difference between
subgroups and decide whether to report an overall pooling or by
subgroup only.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted sensitivity analyses testing the effect of removing
studies we judged to be at high risk of bias to see if those studies
affected the overall result. In analyses where we pooled studies that
compared an intervention with either placebo or no medication
but did not subgroup, we conducted sensitivity analyses testing
removing studies comparing against no medication. In our
comparison of varenicline versus placebo we also conducted a
further ad hoc sensitivity analysis to explore the high level of
heterogeneity, removing studies that used an extended treatment
course of 24 or 52 weeks rather than the 12 weeks of the other
studies.
Because we were primarily interested in whether there is
evidence that varenicline works differently for disease-specific
populations and people in specific subgroups and healthcare
settings, we conducted sensitivity analyses, treating studies in
these populations and settings as subgroups of the main analyses
and using the I2 statistic to test for subgroup differences.
Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence
Following standard Cochrane methods, we produced summary of
findings tables for smoking abstinence at longest follow-up and all
of our serious adverse events outcomes for each comparison of
varenicline or cytisine with placebo or another pharmacotherapy
(Schünemann 2022). Two review authors (JLB, NL) assessed the
certainty of the evidence using the five GRADE considerations (risk
of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and publication
bias (Schünemann 2013).

Assessment of reporting biases

Results of the search

For the two smoking cessation comparisons with 10 or more
studies, we assessed the risk of reporting bias using a funnel plot.
Regardless of the number of studies included, we considered the
possibility of reporting bias in our discussion.

Our literature searches for this update found 810 studies (from
885 records). After we removed duplicates, 682 studies remained
for title and abstract screening. We ruled out 544 studies at this
stage, leaving 138 studies for full-text screening. From this, we
identified 45 new included studies and 20 new ongoing studies,
combined with studies from previous updates of this review, this
resulted in a total of 75 included studies of 45,049 people and 28
ongoing studies. See Figure 1 for PRISMA diagram detailing study
flow (Liberati 2009). For this update, we contacted authors of four
studies and received additional results data.

Data synthesis
We conducted a narrative summary of the included studies and,

eligible intervention with placebo, no medication, another eligible
intervention, or the same intervention delivered with a different

place internationally, in between two and 15 countries. The studies
were conducted in smoking cessation clinics, hospitals, universities
and other research centres.

Included studies

Participants

Full details of the included studies are given in the Characteristics
of included studies tables.

Participants in the majority of trials were adult smokers, willing
to make a quit attempt. Several trials were conducted in clinical
subgroups, including hospital inpatients (Carson-Chahhoud 2020;
Hong 2015; Le Mao 2020; Steinberg 2011; Windle 2018; Wong 2012),
and disease-specific patient groups: cardiovascular disease (Rigotti
2010; Windle 2018); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Hong
2015; Le Mao 2020; Tashkin 2011; Yang 2016); HIV (Ashare
2019; Mercie 2018); asthma (Westergaard 2015); substance use
disorder (Nahvi 2014a; Stein 2013); alcohol dependence (Hurt
2018; O'Malley 2018; Zawertailo 2020); depression (Anthenelli
2013; Cinciripini 2018); and bipolar/schizophrenia, schizoaffective
disorder (Chengappa 2014; Williams 2012). EAGLES 2016 enrolled
two cohorts of adult smokers with and without histories of
psychiatric disorders, including primary affective disorders (70%),
anxiety disorders (19%), psychotic disorders (9.5%) and personality
disorders (0.6%). Gonzales 2014 recruited people who had
previously used varenicline in an unsuccessful quit attempt. De Dios
2012 and Ebbert 2016 tested varenicline in light smokers.

Cytisine
Eight studies in just under 9000 people investigated cytisine as
a smoking cessation drug. Four studies compared cytisine with
placebo, two with varenicline, one with nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT), and one with no medication. Pastorino 2022 also
compared longer with shorter duration cytisine. Studies tested
cytisine at a dose of 9 mg per day for 20 to 25 days, except
for Pastorino 2022, which gave cytisine for 40 and 84 days in
different arms.
Studies were conducted in Australia, Bangladesh and Pakistan,
Italy, East Germany, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, and Poland. Two
studies took place in smoking cessation clinics, and two in the
community. Walker 2014 recruited people who contacted a national
smoking quitline. Vinnikov 2008 was set in a Kyrgyz mining
company, and Dogar 2020 took place in tuberculosis treatment
centres. Pastorino 2022 recruited heavy smokers participating in a
lung-screening trial.
Varenicline
Sixty-eight studies of over 37,000 people tested varenicline for
smoking cessation. This excludes two studies that compared
varenicline with cytisine, which are described above.

Interventions

Forty-seven trials used the standard 12-week regimen of
varenicline, routinely titrating the first week up to the
recommended daily dose of 1 mg twice a day. Nakamura
2007, Nides 2006 and Oncken 2006 tested 1 mg per day, and Niaura
2008 allowed participants to regulate their own dosage throughout
the treatment phase. Ebbert 2015 and Stein 2013 tested a 24-week
regimen, and Williams 2007 tested 52 weeks.

Setting

Twenty-eight studies were conducted in the USA, four in Canada,
three in China, three in Japan, two in France, two in Greece, two in

Comparators

Forty-five studies compared varenicline with placebo and five with
no medication. Of the 14 studies that compared varenicline with
NRT, 12 randomised participants to receive single-form NRT and
five to a combination of two or more forms of NRT (3 studies tested
varenicline against both NRT monotherapy and combination NRT).
Ten studies compared varenicline with bupropion.
Seven studies compared standard varenicline with either a lower
dose (4 studies) or a longer duration (3 studies).
Outcomes

All studies measured smoking cessation at least six months after
study baseline. Follow-up lengths ranged from six months to
two years. Many studies biochemically validated abstinence using
either exhaled carbon monoxide, or salivary or urinary cotinine.
Thirty-eight studies measured adverse events, including
insomnia, abnormal dreams, headache, depression, and
ideation. Twenty-eight measured serious adverse
neuropsychiatric serious adverse events and cardiac
adverse events.

Dianicline
One trial investigated dianicline. It was set in 22 sites across six
European countries (Tonstad 2011). Dianicline was administered as
a 40 mg tablet twice a day for seven weeks, with brief counselling at
each contact. Final follow-up of the participants was at 26 weeks,
with self-reported abstinence verified by expired carbon monoxide
and by plasma cotinine samples.
Study funding
Of the trials included in this review, 35 received funds from
pharmaceutical companies with interests in the treatment being
tested, 13 received free study medications, and four trials without
pharmaceutical support had authors who had received funds for
other work. Fifteen studies reported no conflicts, and two did
not report study funding or author declarations of interests. This
is significant because a recent analysis found that authors of
opinion pieces on varenicline who reported financial ties to the
pharmaceutical industry (as a conflict of interest or funding source)
were more likely to minimise the cardiovascular and psychiatric
risk of varenicline compared to those without conflicts of interest
or industry funding (odds ratio 4.00, 95% CI 1.32 to 12.16 for
cardiovascular risk; odds ratio 8.51, 95% CI 3.79 to 19.11 for
psychiatric risk; Fabbri 2022).
Excluded studies

studies tables. Common reasons for exclusion were following
up with participants for less than six months, not randomising
participants, testing an eligible intervention for an ineligible
purpose (smoking reduction or alcohol dependence), or testing
another intervention as an adjunct to an eligible one.
For this update we excluded 14 studies that were included in the
previous version of the review. Evins 2014, Tonstad 2006, Tønnesen
2013, and NCT00828113 recruited already abstinent participants
and tested varenicline for relapse prevention, a topic covered
in a different Cochrane Review (Livingstone-Banks 2019).
We excluded Hajek 2015 because follow-up was under six
months. Brandon 2011, Ebbert 2011b, Faessel 2009, Fagerström
2010, Garza 2011, Hughes 2011, McClure 2013, Meszaros
2013 and Mitchell 2012 were previously included for data on harms
only but did not meet all of our prespecified inclusion criteria.
We did not find sufficient information to include or exclude two
studies. These are listed in Characteristics of studies awaiting
classification.
Ongoing studies
We found 28 eligible ongoing studies, some with multiple relevant
comparisons. Studies that tested varenicline compared it with
placebo (11 studies), no medication (two studies), bupropion (one
study), NRT (seven studies), e-cigarettes (one study), and different
doses or regimes of varenicline (six studies). Studies that tested
cytisine compared it with placebo (two studies), varenicline (two
studies), NRT (one study), and e-cigarettes (one study).
Studies were set in various populations and setting, including
HIV (three studies), hospital and perioperative patients (three
studies), cardiovascular disease (three studies), substance abuse
(two studies), mental health (two studies), and single studies
in lung cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
adolescents, and e-cigarette users who smoke.

Risk of bias in included studies
Overall, we judged 22 studies to be at low risk of bias (low risk
of bias across all domains), 18 at high risk of bias (high risk of
bias in at least one domain), and the remaining 35 at unclear risk
of bias. Our judgements on the risks of bias of all the included
studies are summarised in Figure 2 and Figure 3, and reasons
for the judgements are detailed in the Characteristics of included
studies tables.

We judged one study to be at high risk of allocation bias as a result
of inadequate concealment of randomisation because that study's
participant allocation was unblinded. We judged 34 studies to be at
unclear risk because there was insufficient information to make a
judgement. We judged the remaining studies to be at low risk.
Blinding
We judged 10 studies to be at high risk of performance or detection
bias because they were open-label studies without blinding of
participant allocation. We judged 13 studies to be at unclear risk
because there was insufficient information to make a judgement.
The remaining studies were deemed at low risk.
Incomplete outcome data
We judged five studies to be at high risk of attrition bias, four
because of either high levels of attrition or highly differential
attrition rates between study arms, and one that did not provide a
baseline number of participants, and reported only those followed
up at 12 months as a denominator (Benli 2017). We judged 20
studies to be at unclear risk because of insufficient reporting of
follow-up rates for us to make a judgement. The remaining studies
were deemed at low risk.
Selective reporting
We judged two studies to be at high risk of reporting bias.
In Nakamura 2007, continuous abstinence rates for all participants
were reported, but demographics, withdrawal and craving
measures, and point-prevalence abstinence were reported for the
nicotine-dependent subset of participants only. The trial registry
entry for Tuisku 2016 planned a 12-month follow-up, which was not
reported in their results paper. However, it is possible that this may
be reported in a subsequent paper. We judged 18 studies to be at
unclear risk because there was insufficient information to make a
judgement; typically because no protocol or trial registry entry was
available. We judged the remaining studies to be at low risk.
Other potential sources of bias
We judged two studies to be at high risk of bias for other reasons.
For Ioakeimidis 2018, we found only an abstract and poster,
which reported different quit rates in the e-cigarette arm. Zincir
2013 reported that no participants experienced adverse events,
which is unlikely given standard definitions of adverse events.
We judged five studies to be at unclear risk of bias from other
sources. In Rose 2013, there was a minor unexplained reporting
disparity, with different denominators given for the varenicline
arm. Walker 2014 supplied cytisine for free, while NRT users had
to pay a nominal charge (NZD 3 for an 8-week course of each
NRT item). Le Mao 2020 reported that their small sample size
was because of premature interruption of pharmaceutical funding.
Cinciripini 2013 began comparing nortriptyline with bupropion, but
after three months nortriptyline was changed to varenicline. In
Chengappa 2014, four participants in each arm received bupropion
for depression. Three out of 15 varenicline quitters and one out of
three placebo quitters were on long-term bupropion.

Summary of findings 5; Summary of findings 6; Summary of

Cytisine versus placebo or no medication
Smoking cessation
We pooled five studies that compared cytisine to either placebo or
no medication, subgrouping by comparator type (placebo versus
no medication). We found evidence of a substantial subgroup
difference (I2 = 97.3%; Analysis 1.1) and so present the subgroup
effects separately here. Four studies, including 4623 participants,
compared standard dose cytisine (9 mg per day) with placebo.
More people successfully quit smoking in the cytisine arm (RR
1.30, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.47; moderate-certainty evidence; Analysis
1.1.1), but there was a high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 83%).
We present the pooled estimate despite this heterogeneity as
all point estimates suggested a benefit from cytisine. Pastorino
2022 compared standard-dose cytisine with no medication. This
three-arm trial tested different durations of cytisine (40 days and
84 days), so we split the control arm. More people randomised to
receive cytisine successfully quit than in the no-medication arm (RR
4.44, 95% CI 3.06 to 6.46; I2 = 0%; 869 participants; Analysis 1.1.2).
We were unable to conduct our planned sensitivity analysis
removing studies at high risk of bias because we judged all studies
comparing with placebo to be at low or unclear risk and the sole
study comparing with no medication to be at high risk.
Adverse events
None of the studies in this comparison measured our prespecified
adverse events outcomes, so we pooled all non-serious adverse
events. Results from four studies of 4052 participants showed that
more people randomised to receive cytisine reported experiencing
non-serious adverse events than those randomised to receive
placebo or no medication (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39; I2
= 0%; Analysis 1.2). However, a sensitivity analysis removing
one study comparing cytisine with no medication resulted in a
confidence interval that crossed the null (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.97 to
1.46; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 3183 participants).
Serious adverse events
Results from three studies of 3781 participants comparing cytisine
with placebo or no medication showed no evidence of difference
in the number who experienced serious adverse events (RR 1.04,
95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.3). A
sensitivity analysis removing one study comparing cytisine with no
medication did not affect the interpretation of this result (RR 1.15,
95% CI 0.79 to 1.67; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 3012 participants). None of

the studies measured neuropsychiatric or cardiac serious adverse
events.
Cytisine: variations in usage
Pastorino 2022 compared 40 days and 84 days of cytisine, and
found that more people successfully quit on the longer treatment,
although confidence intervals did cross the null, indicating the
potential for no difference in the effects (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.67;
480 participants; Analysis 2.1).

course of cytisine, and study authors reported that at week one 26
participants were using NRT obtained through the vouchers; only
19 participants used NRT and cytisine concomitantly. This study
found that more people in the cytisine arm successfully quit than
in the NRT arm (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80; 1310 participants; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 4.1).
Adverse events
Nausea was the only one of our adverse event outcomes
measured. Walker 2014 reported that, compared with people
randomised to receive NRT, those in the cytisine arm were more
likely to report experiencing nausea (RR 15.00, 95% CI 3.60 to 62.51;
1310 participants; Analysis 4.2).

Two studies including 2131 people compared standard-dose
cytisine (9 mg per day) with standard-dose varenicline (2 mg per
day). The point estimate showed more people quitting in the
varenicline arm, but confidence intervals indicate imprecision and
incorporate the potential for no difference or slight benefit from
cytisine (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; I2 = 0%; moderate-certainty
evidence; point estimate favours varenicline; Analysis 3.1).

Walker 2014 did not find evidence of a difference in the rate
of serious adverse events between those randomised to receive
cytisine or NRT (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.75; 1310 participants; very
low-certainty evidence; Analysis 4.3). Walker 2014 did not measure
neuropsychiatric or cardiac serious adverse events.

Adverse events

Varenicline versus placebo or no medication

Two studies of 2017 participants found that people randomised to
receive cytisine were less likely to report experiencing nausea (RR
0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.2) and abnormal dreams
(RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.73; I2 = 58%; Analysis 3.3) than those in
the varenicline arm.

Smoking cessation

The same two studies of 2017 participants, found no evidence of
clear differences between the cytisine and varenicline arms in the
number of people experiencing insomnia (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73 to
1.10; I2 = 68%; Analysis 3.4), headaches (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to
1.33; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.5), and suicidal ideation (RR 0.33, 95% CI
0.01 to 8.02; I2 not estimable as events only in 1 study; Analysis 3.7).
However, in all cases confidence intervals indicated imprecision,
and the potential for more adverse events when using either
treatment.
One study of 679 participants did not find evidence of a clear
difference between cytisine and varenicline arms in the number
of people experiencing depression (RR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to
74.47; Analysis 3.6); however, this result should also be treated with
caution because of substantial imprecision.
Serious adverse events
Two studies of 2017 participants compared the number of people
in cytisine and varenicline arms reporting experiencing serious
adverse events. The point estimate showed that fewer people
in the cytisine arm reported serious adverse events (RR 0.67,
95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; I2 = 45%; low-certainty evidence; point
estimate favours cytisine; Analysis 3.8), but confidence intervals did
incorporate the potential for no difference. Neither study measured
neuropsychiatric or cardiac serious adverse events.
Cytisine versus nicotine replacement therapy

Serious adverse events

We pooled studies that compared varenicline to either placebo
or no medication, subgrouping by comparator type (placebo or
no medication). We found evidence of a substantial subgroup
difference (I2 = 95.8%; Analysis 5.1) and so present the subgroup
effects separately here. Forty-six studies compared standard-dose
varenicline (2 mg per day) with either placebo or no medication.
Our meta-analysis found that more people successfully quit
smoking when randomised to receive varenicline compared with
placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.51; I2 = 60%, 41 studies, 17,395
participants; high-certainty evidence; Analysis 5.1.1) or with no
medication (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.80; I2 = 95%; 5 studies, 1050
participants; Analysis 5.1.2). Despite the substantial heterogeneity
in the latter subgroup we present the pooled estimate as all the
individual study point estimates suggested a benefit of varenicline.
A sensitivity analysis removing studies at high risk of bias did not
reduce the heterogeneity found in the varenicline versus placebo
analysis or the interpretation of the effect. However, removing three
studies that used an extended treatment course of 24 or 52 weeks
rather than the 12 weeks of the other studies, resulted in a minor
impact, reducing the I2 statistic to 53%. We were unable to conduct
a sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies for the
varenicline versus no medication analysis, as we judged all studies
to be at high risk.
King 2022 tested varenicline combined with NRT patch against NRT
patch with a varenicline placebo. We did not include this study in
our analysis, but it showed no clear evidence of a difference in quit
rates as a result of adding varenicline (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.72;
122 participants). However, confidence intervals incorporated the
possibilities of both an increased and a decreased quit rate, as well
as no difference.

Smoking cessation
Walker 2014 provided participants with cytisine, compared with an
eight-week course of NRT, supplied in the form of vouchers that
required redemption by participants. Participants in the cytisine
arm also received vouchers for NRT to use after their initial 25-day

Adverse events
Studies comparing varenicline with placebo or no medication
found that people randomised to receive varenicline were more
likely to report experiencing nausea (RR 2.61, 95% CI 2.44 to 2.80;

I2 = 79%; 36 studies, 17,080 participants; Analysis 5.2), insomnia
(RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.47; I2 = 29%; 35 studies, 16,803
participants; Analysis 5.3), abnormal dreams (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.67
to 1.97; I2 = 70%; 32 studies, 16,211 participants; Analysis 5.4), and
headaches (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19; I2 = 30%; 31 studies, 16,326
participants; Analysis 5.5). Statistical heterogeneity was substantial
in our analyses for nausea and abnormal dreams, but we decided
to present the pooled estimate because the point estimates of
individuals studies were almost entirely in the same direction.
Studies comparing varenicline with placebo or no medication did
not find clear evidence of difference in the numbers of participants
who reported experiencing depression (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to
1.20; I2 = 0%; 32 studies, 15,922 participants; Analysis 5.6), and
found fewer people reporting suicidal ideation in the varenicline
arm (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.08; I2 = 0%; 22 studies, 12,343
participants; Analysis 5.7). However, confidence intervals indicated
imprecision, and included the potential for harm as well as no
difference.
We conducted sensitivity analyses removing studies comparing
varenicline with no medication rather than placebo, but this had no
substantial impact on heterogeneity or results.
Serious adverse event
Serious adverse events

Twenty-six studies of 14,356 participants found that more people
randomised to receive varenicline reported experiencing serious
adverse events than those randomised to receive placebo or no
medication (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.48; I2 = 0%; moderatecertainty evidence; Analysis 5.8). Absolute rates for serious adverse
events were 3.3% and 2.7% in varenicline and control arms
respectively. King 2022 tested varenicline combined with NRT patch
against NRT patch with a varenicline placebo. We did not include
this study in our analysis, but it reported two participants with
serious adverse events in the varenicline arm and none in the NRTalone arm. A sensitivity analysis removing one study comparing
varenicline with no medication had no substantial impact on this
result.
Neuropsychiatric serious adverse events

The point estimate from pooling 22 studies of 7846 people showed
that fewer people reported experiencing neuropsychiatric serious
adverse events in the varenicline arm compared with placebo
or no medication (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.29; I2 = 0%; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 5.9). However confidence intervals
demonstrated imprecision, also encompassing the possibility of
more neuropsychiatric serious adverse events in the varenicline
arm. A sensitivity analysis removing one study comparing
varenicline with no medication had no substantial impact on this
result.
Cardiac serious adverse events

The point estimate from pooling 18 studies of 7151 people
showed that more people reported experiencing cardiac serious
adverse events in the varenicline arm compared with placebo
or no medication (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.84; I2 = 0%; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 5.10). However confidence intervals
demonstrated imprecision, also encompassing the possibility of no
difference or fewer serious adverse events in the varenicline arm. A

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

sensitivity analysis removing one study comparing varenicline with
no medication had no substantial impact on this result.
Varenicline: variations in usage
Low-dose varenicline versus placebo
Four studies tested varenicline at doses lower than standard (under
2 mg per day). Three studies tested 1 mg per day compared with
placebo and still found that more people quit in the varenicline arm
(RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.60; 906 participants; Analysis 6.1.1). There
was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 71%), however in all cases point
estimates favoured varenicline.
Niaura 2008 allowed participants to choose their own dose of
varenicline, ranging between 0.5 mg and 2.0 mg daily, and found
more people in the varenicline arm quit than in the placebo arm (RR
2.92, 95% CI 1.57 to 5.41; 320 participants; Analysis 6.1.2).
Higher-dose varenicline versus lower-dose varenicline
Four studies compared varenicline at 2 mg per day with 1 mg
per day and did not provide clear evidence of a difference in
how many people quit (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.30; 1563
participants; I2 = 44%; Analysis 6.2.1); however confidence intervals
encompassed potential benefit and a slight disadvantage of the
higher dose. Nides 2006 also compared other dosages and also
did not find clear evidence of a difference in quit rates among
participants randomised to receive 2 mg compared with 0.3 mg per
day (RR 1.84 95% CI 0.89 to 3.84; 253 participants; Analysis 6.2.2) or
1 mg compared with 0.3 mg per day (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.81;
254 participants; Analysis 6.2.3). However, in both cases confidence
intervals were wide and may indicate benefit and harm of higher
doses.
Longer-duration varenicline versus standard-duration
varenicline
Three studies tested extended durations of varenicline compared
with standard duration of varenicline (12 weeks). We found no
clear evidence of a difference as a result of extending varenicline
treatment to 24 weeks (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; I2 = 17%; 2
studies, 1458 participants; Analysis 6.3.1) or 52 weeks (RR 1.30, 95%
CI 0.70 to 2.43; 1 study; 107 participants; Analysis 6.3.2). However,
the confidence intervals indicate imprecision and uncertainty in the
point estimates.
Six weeks versus one week of varenicline preloading
Bohadana 2020 tested varenicline with a preloading period of six
weeks before quit date against the standard one week of preloading
and found that more people in the six-week preloading arm quit
than in the one-week arm (RR 5.60, 95% CI 2.24 to 14.02; 242
participants).
Varenicline in specific patient groups
Studies testing varenicline against placebo or no medication in
specific patient populations did not find any clear evidence of
varenicline working differently in these groups than in the general
population.
Analyses found more people successfully quitting in the varenicline
arm than in control in studies of people with cardiovascular
disease (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.47; I2 = 81%; 2 studies,
1006 participants; Analysis 7.1); schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,

or another psychiatric disorder (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.86; I2 =
0%; 3 studies, 2245 participants; Analysis 7.4); depression (RR 2.17,
95% CI 1.45 to 3.24; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 745 participants; Analysis
7.5); HIV (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.63; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 427
participants; Analysis 7.8); and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.69; I2 = 94%; 4 studies of 860
participants; Analysis 7.2).
Treating these trials as a subgroup of the main analysis (Analysis
5.1), testing for subgroup differences showed no evidence that
varenicline works differently from in the general population:
cardiovascular disease, P = 0.24, I2 = 26.2%; psychiatric disorders,
P = 0.40, I2 = 0%; depression, P = 0.92, I2 = 0%; HIV, P =
0.69, I2 = 0%). Testing the COPD result for subgroup difference
initially showed evidence that varenicline may work differently,
with lower effectiveness, in this population (P < 0.00001, I2 =
96.8%), however this difference disappeared when we performed
a sensitivity analysis removing studies comparing varenicline with
no medication rather than placebo (P = 1.00, I2 = 0%).
Analyses presented inconclusive evidence for three patient
populations: asthma (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.14; 1 study; 52
participants; Analysis 7.3), substance use disorder (RR 3.72, 95%
CI 0.50 to 27.59; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 294 participants; Analysis 7.6),
and alcohol dependence (RR 3.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 9.92; I2 = 54%; 3
studies, 195 participants; Analysis 7.7). However, point estimates
all favoured varenicline, and wide confidence intervals were likely
the result of very low numbers of events. Treating the trials as
a subgroup of the main analysis (Analysis 5.1) and testing for
subgroup differences showed no evidence that varenicline works
differently in these populations (asthma: P = 0.76, I2 = 0.4%;
substance use disorder: P = 0.61, I2 = 0%; alcohol dependence: P =
0.70, I2 = 0.4%).
Varenicline in specific settings or subgroups
Six studies of 1324 participants tested varenicline against placebo
or no medication among hospital inpatients and perioperative
patients and found that more people successfully quit in the
varenicline arm (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.43; I2 = 58%; Analysis
8.1). Treating these trials as a subgroup of the main analysis
(Analysis 5.1), which includes studies conducted in both clinical
and community settings such as cessation clinics and university
campuses, and testing for subgroup differences did show evidence
of subgroup difference, with lower effectiveness (P < 0.00001;
I2 = 98.6%). Heterogeneity remained when we performed a
sensitivity analysis removing studies comparing varenicline with no
medication rather than placebo (P < 0.00001; I2 = 96%).
Gonzales 2014 tested varenicline against placebo among people
who had previously used varenicline for two weeks or more, at
least three months prior to admission to the study, and had not
successfully quit but were motivated to try again. This single study
found that more people successfully quit in the varenicline arm (RR
6.15, 95% CI 2.98 to 12.70; 494 participants; Analysis 8.2).
Two studies of 114 participants tested varenicline against placebo
among light smokers and found that more people successfully
quit in the varenicline arm (RR 4.16, 95% CI 1.58 to 10.97; I2 =
0%; Analysis 8.3). Treating these trials as a subgroup of the main
analysis (Analysis 5.1) and testing for subgroup differences showed

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

no evidence that varenicline works differently in this population (P
= 0.20, I2 = 39.3%).
Varenicline versus bupropion
Smoking cessation
Nine studies of 7560 participants compared varenicline with
bupropion and found that more people quit smoking when using
varenicline (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.49; I2 = 0%; high-certainty
evidence; Analysis 9.1).
Johns 2017b randomised 300 participants to receive varenicline,
bupropion, or both. They did not provide any useable results data
but reported that more people quit in the combined varenicline
and bupropion arm compared with the bupropion- or vareniclinealone arms. However, only an abstract was available for this study,
and without further information, this result should be treated with
caution.
Adverse events
Studies comparing varenicline with bupropion found that people
randomised to receive varenicline were more likely to report
experiencing nausea (RR 2.46, 95% CI 2.20 to 2.75; I2 = 0%; 4 studies,
5808 participants; Analysis 9.2), abnormal dreams (RR 1.56, 95%
CI 1.39 to 1.76; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 5808 participants; Analysis 9.4),
and headache (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45; I2 = 13%; 3 studies,
4888 participants; Analysis 9.5). However, people randomised
to receive varenicline were less likely to report experiencing
insomnia (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.93; I2 = 75%; 6 studies, 6789
participants; Analysis 9.3).
Two studies of 4210 people did not find evidence a difference
between those randomised to receive varenicline or bupropion in
reported rates of depression (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.35; I2 =
0%; Analysis 9.6) or suicidal ideation (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.93;
I2 not estimable as events only in 1 study; Analysis 9.7).
Serious adverse events
Serious adverse events

Five studies of 5317 people did not find evidence of a clear
difference in the number of people reporting experiencing serious
adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; low-certainty
evidence; Analysis 9.8).
Neuropsychiatric serious adverse events

Two studies of 866 people did not find evidence of a clear difference
in the number of people reporting experiencing neuropsychiatric
serious adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.04; I2 = 10%; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 9.9), though confidence intervals were
very wide.
Cardiac serious adverse events

Two studies of 866 people did not find evidence of a clear difference
in the number of people reporting experiencing cardiac serious
adverse events (RR 3.17, 95% CI 0.33 to 30.18; I2 = 0%; low-certainty
evidence; Analysis 9.10), though confidence intervals were very
wide.

Varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
monotherapy
Smoking cessation
Eleven studies of 7572 participants compared varenicline with NRT
monotherapy and found that more people quit smoking in the
varenicline arm (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.37; I2 = 28%; highcertainty evidence; Analysis 10.1).
Adverse events
Studies comparing varenicline with NRT monotherapy found that
people randomised to receive varenicline were more likely to report
experiencing nausea (RR 2.69, 95% CI 2.41 to 3.01; I2 = 59%; 6
studies, 6500 participants; Analysis 10.2) and headache (RR 1.14,
95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; I2 = 69%; 4 studies, 6287 participants; Analysis
10.5). However, they did not find evidence of a clear difference in
the number of people reporting experiencing insomnia (RR 1.08,
95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; I2 = 42%; 5 studies, 6319 participants; Analysis
10.3), abnormal dreams (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05; I2 = 67%; 4
studies, 5803 participants; Analysis 10.4), or depression (RR 0.94,
95% CI 0.76 to 1.16; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 5541 participants; Analysis
10.6). The pooled point estimate from two studies found a higher
rate of suicidal ideation among participants in the varenicline
arm (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 28.77; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 4876
participants; Analysis 10.7), but confidence intervals were very wide
and incorporated the potential for no difference or reduced harm.
Statistical heterogeneity was substantial in several analyses, but
we decided to present the pooled estimate because the point
estimates of individuals studies were almost entirely in the same
direction in each analysis.
Serious adverse events
Serious adverse events

Six studies of 6535 people comparing varenicline with NRT
monotherapy found that people randomised to receive varenicline
were less likely to report experiencing serious adverse events (RR
0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; I2 = 24%; low-certainty evidence; Analysis
10.8).
Neuropsychiatric serious adverse events

Only one study measured neuropsychiatric serious adverse events,
and reported no events in either arm (Rohsenow 2017; 137
participants).
Cardiac serious adverse events

Only one study measured cardiac serious adverse events,
and reported no events in either arm (Rohsenow 2017; 137
participants).
Varenicline versus combination NRT
Smoking cessation
Five studies of 2344 participants compared varenicline with
combination NRT and did not detect evidence of a clear difference
in the number of people who quit smoking, although confidence
intervals indicate imprecision, which reduces our certainty in
the effect (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; I2 = 0%; low-certainty
evidence; Analysis 11.1).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Adverse events
Studies comparing varenicline with combination NRT found that
people randomised to receive varenicline were more likely to report
experiencing nausea (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.15; I2 = 47%; 3
studies, 1609 participants; Analysis 11.2), insomnia (RR 1.40, 95%
CI 1.15 to 1.70; I2 = 82%; 3 studies, 1609 participants; Analysis 11.3),
and abnormal dreams (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.08; 1 study; 549
participants; Analysis 11.4). However, they did not find evidence of
a clear difference in the number of people reporting experiencing
headache (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.23; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 1609
participants; Analysis 11.5), depression (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to
1.40; I2 = 82%; 3 studies, 1609 participants; Analysis 11.6), or suicidal
ideation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.79; I2 not estimable as events
only in 1 study; 2 studies, 764 participants; Analysis 11.7). Statistical
heterogeneity was substantial in several analyses, but we decided
to present the pooled estimate because the point estimates of
individual studies were almost entirely in the same direction.
Serious adverse events
Serious adverse events

Pooled data from four studies of 1852 people showed more people
in the varenicline arm reporting serious adverse events compared
with combination NRT (RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.49 to 9.46; I2 = 0%; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 11.8). However, confidence intervals
were very wide and included the potential for no difference or
reduced risk.
Neuropsychiatric serious adverse events

Two studies of 764 people reported the number of people reporting
neuropsychiatric serious adverse events. While the point estimate
suggested participants receiving varenicline were more likely
to report experiencing neuropsychiatric serious adverse events,
confidence intervals were extremely wide, and incorporated both
benefit and harm (RR 4.69, 95% CI 0.23 to 96.50; I2 not estimable as
events only in 1 study; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 11.9).
Cardiac serious adverse events

Two studies of 819 people reported the number of people reporting
cardiac serious adverse events. While the point estimate suggested
that participants receiving varenicline were less likely to report
experiencing cardiac serious adverse events, confidence intervals
were very wide, and incorporated both benefit and harm (RR 0.32,
95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; I2 not estimable as events only in 1 study; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 11.10).
Varenicline versus e-cigarettes
Smoking cessation
One study of 54 participants compared varenicline with e-cigarettes
and found that more people quit smoking in the varenicline arm
(RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.21 to 8.71; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis
12.1).
Adverse events
The only one of our adverse event outcomes reported by this
study was nausea. While the point estimate suggested that
participants receiving varenicline were more likely to report
experiencing nausea, confidence intervals were extremely wide,

and incorporated both benefit and harm (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to
27.06; Analysis 12.2).
Serious adverse events
While the study reported serious adverse events, neuropsychiatric
serious adverse events, and cardiac serious adverse events as
outcomes, they reported no events among study participants in
either arm.
Dianicline versus placebo
Smoking cessation
Tonstad 2011 (602 participants) compared dianicline with placebo
and did not detect evidence of a clear difference in the number of
people who quit smoking (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.75; Analysis
13.1), however, results were imprecise and confidence intervals
encompass the possibility of benefit and harm of dianicline.
Adverse events
Tonstad 2011 reported that more people randomised to receive
dianicline reported experiencing nausea (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.88 to
4.27; 602 participants; Analysis 13.2) and depression (RR 8.05, 95%
CI 1.01 to 63.99; 602 participants; Analysis 13.4) than those in the
placebo arm. They did not detect a difference in the number of
people reporting experiencing headaches (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82 to
1.85; 602 participants; Analysis 13.3). The study did not measure our
other adverse event outcomes.
Serious adverse events
Tonstad 2011 did not detect a difference in rates of serious adverse
events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.95; 602 participants; Analysis 13.5)
or cardiac serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.02; 602
participants; Analysis 13.6) between participants in the dianicline
and placebo study arms. However, in both instances confidence
intervals were very wide and included the potential for both harm
and benefit. The study did not measure neuropsychiatric serious
adverse events.

DISCUSSION
Summary of main results
This review includes eight studies that investigated cytisine use in
just under 9000 people, 68 studies that investigated varenicline use
in over 37,000 people, and one study that investigated dianicline
use in 602 people. Forty-five of these studies are new to this update.
We found moderate-certainty evidence that cytisine probably
helps more people to quit smoking than placebo. While people
randomised to receive cytisine were more likely to experience
adverse events than those in the placebo arm, low-certainty
evidence gave no clear indication of an increased risk of serious
adverse events. We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac
serious adverse events.
Our analysis did not find definitive evidence of a difference
in cessation rates between cytisine and varenicline. The
point estimate favoured varenicline, but this moderate-certainty
evidence is subject to imprecision and may change as more
evidence becomes available. A component network meta-analysis
that is currently underway may reveal a more certain result by
also employing data from indirect comparisons (Lindson 2022).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Although the point estimates in the separate analyses comparing
varenicline with placebo and cytisine with placebo did differ (with
the varenicline analysis producing a higher risk ratio) the issue with
this type of indirect comparison is it does not adjust for potential
differences in baseline event rates. In our analysis, Dogar 2020 was
the largest study that compared cytisine with placebo. It recruited
people diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis who, as part of
the behavioural aspect of the intervention, were informed of the
dangers of continued tobacco use in people with tuberculosis. This
made for a highly motivated population, who also happened to
smoke fewer cigarettes per day than in other cytisine trials. These
two characteristics may have contributed to the higher placebo arm
quit rates in the cytisine studies and minimised the benefit gained
from pharmacotherapy. These factors may also explain why the
results from Dogar 2020 are less compelling than those of the other
studies, and may also account for the statistical heterogeneity in
the cytisine versus placebo analysis (I2 = 83%).
Participants in the cytisine arm were less likely to experience
nausea or abnormal dreams than those in the varenicline arm,
and there was no evidence of a difference in rates of insomnia,
headache, depression, or suicidal ideation. The same studies
provided low-certainty evidence of fewer people experiencing
serious adverse events in the cytisine arm compared with
varenicline. However, in all cases, confidence intervals indicated
imprecision, and the potential for more adverse events when using
either treatment. We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac
serious adverse events.
Low-certainty evidence suggested that cytisine may help more
people to quit than NRT monotherapy (Walker 2014). However,
after the initial 25-day course, participants in the cytisine arm
also received vouchers for NRT. This may distort the results as
some participants in the cytisine arm may have in fact received
two pharmacotherapies, but study authors reported that few
participants in the cytisine arm used their NRT vouchers. Lowcertainty evidence did not show a difference in the number of
people reporting serious adverse events. We found no data on
neuropsychiatric or cardiac serious adverse events.
Evidence on the effect of different lengths of cytisine treatment was
sparse and inconclusive.
There is high-certainty evidence that varenicline increases the
chances of successful smoking cessation by more than two-fold
compared with placebo. Since the previous version of this review
was published (Cahill 2016), this estimate has remained stable,
despite the growing inclusion of pragmatic trials in real-world
settings and those conducted in particular groups of smokers
previously excluded from clinical trials, such as those in lower- and
middle-income countries, and in disease-specific populations.
We also found high-certainty evidence that varenicline helped more
people to quit than bupropion, or NRT monotherapy, with no clear
evidence of difference between varenicline and bupropion in rates
of serious adverse events, neuropsychiatric serious adverse events,
or cardiac serious adverse events (all low-certainty evidence),
and low-certainty evidence suggesting reduced risk of serious
adverse events compared with NRT. We found no data comparing
varenicline with NRT monotherapy for neuropsychiatric or cardiac
serious adverse events.

Low-certainty evidence did not show a difference in quit rates
compared with combination NRT, and while low-certainty evidence
suggested potentially increased risk of serious adverse events
and neuropsychiatric serious adverse events, and reduced risk of
cardiac serious adverse events, in all cases confidence intervals
were very wide, encompassing both substantial harm and benefit.
One small study of 54 people provided very-low certainty evidence
of more people quitting with varenicline than with e-cigarettes
(Ioakeimidis 2018); however this study was at high risk of bias
and imprecise due to few events, and while they reported serious
adverse events, neuropsychiatric serious adverse events, and
cardiac serious adverse events as outcomes, they reported no
events among study participants in either arm. Studies that
tested varenicline versus placebo in specific populations and
settings did not demonstrate varenicline working differently than
it does in the general population in disease-specific groups
of patients (e.g. cardiovascular, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, HIV, schizophrenia and psychiatric disorders, depression,
alcohol dependence), or in specific subgroups or settings (e.g.
hospital inpatients, light-smokers, smokers who failed to quit on
varenicline previously).
Analyses found evidence of increased rates of adverse events
such as nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and headache
among people randomised to receive varenicline compared with
placebo. However, we found no clear evidence of increased rates
of depression or suicidal ideation, although confidence intervals
indicated imprecision, and the potential for more or fewer adverse
events when using varenicline compared with control. Moderatecertainty serious adverse event data suggest there may be a
23% increased risk of such events among the varenicline groups

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

compared with the controls. However, serious adverse events
were still rare (2.7% to 4% of people on varenicline, compared
with 2.7% of people without) and this finding is based on simple
counts across the trials of participants reporting one or more
such events, thus not distinguishing between events attributed
and those unrelated to treatment. We did not find evidence of
an increased risk of neuropsychiatric serious adverse events, but
pooled results did suggest a potential increased risk of cardiac
serious adverse events, although again these results were subject
to imprecision, and we deemed this evidence to be low certainty
because of its compatibility with both increased and decreased risk
of harm.
One trial compared dianicline with placebo for smoking cessation
and the results were inconclusive (Tonstad 2011).

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
We conducted systematic searches of multiple online databases,
including clinical trials registries and followed Cochrane methods
for screening. We therefore expect that any published trials we
have missed will be through chance rather than systematic error.
We were able to assess publication bias for two comparisons by
constructing funnel plots: varenicline versus placebo (Figure 4), and
varenicline versus NRT monotherapy (Figure 5). Figure 5 appears
to show a small amount of asymmetry that may suggest a lack
of smaller trials with negative findings. However, the number of
studies is still very low with few smaller studies, and so we cannot
treat this as definitive evidence of publication bias. These were
the only cessation comparisons with enough studies to construct
a funnel plot, so we were unable to assess publication bias for
other comparisons. As such, we cannot ignore the possibility of
publication bias for some comparisons in this review.

The benefits of varenicline for smoking cessation is now well
established, with the point estimate remaining unchanged as
more studies (including non-manufacturer- (Pfizer) funded trials)
accumulate. Trials are now being conducted and reported in areas
where the evidence is less comprehensive, such as testing cytisine
(against placebo and varenicline), and testing varenicline in specific
populations and settings, and in variations of treatment dose or
duration.

We judged the evidence comparing cytisine with placebo to be
of moderate certainty for smoking cessation and low certainty
for serious adverse events, downgraded due to substantial
unexplained heterogeneity and imprecision, respectively. We
judged the evidence comparing cytisine with varenicline for
smoking cessation and serious adverse events to be of moderate
and low certainty, respectively, downgraded for imprecision in both
cases.

Quality of the evidence

We judged the evidence comparing varenicline with bupropion and
NRT monotherapy for smoking cessation to be of high certainty, and
with combination NRT to be of low certainty, limited by imprecision.
Only one small study compared varenicline with e-cigarettes for
smoking cessation, and we graded this evidence as of very low
certainty because of imprecision and risk of bias.

We judged the evidence comparing varenicline with placebo for
smoking cessation to be of high certainty. While we detected
moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 60%), all but three studies had a
point estimate that favoured varenicline over placebo, so we did
not downgrade on this basis. The effectiveness of varenicline for
smoking cessation has remained constant through several updates
of this review, and we think it is unlikely to change with further
evidence. We judged the evidence on serious adverse events to
be of moderate certainty, downgraded because of imprecision.
For cardiac and neuropsychiatric serious adverse events, we
downgraded evidence to low because of imprecision. Despite
respectable numbers of studies and participants in each analysis,
because of the rarity of these kinds of adverse events, there were
very few events in the analyses, with some studies reporting no
events at all.

Potential biases in the review process
We have followed standard Cochrane methodology, which
endeavours to minimise biases in the review process, so we are
confident that any errors in our data will be through chance
rather than systematic error. However, it is impossible to rule out
individual errors in the review process.
A potential limitation to our review is that for data on harms we
relied on adverse events and serious adverse events as defined
by papers reporting included studies. This does not take into
account whether those events were genuinely attributable to the
tested interventions. Further, we only considered the number of

participants reporting these events, which does not account for
people who experienced more than one event.
Another potential limitation is that the majority of varenicline trials
reported in this review received either funding or study medication
from Pfizer Inc, the manufacturers of varenicline. Evidence from
systematic reviews suggests that industry-funded trials, although
conducted to a high standard, are more likely to have outcomes
favourable to the product sponsor than studies with other sponsors
(Etter 2007; Walsh 2011). However, we deem the provision of study
medication less likely to amount to the kind of sponsorship that
may bias results, and modern trials increasingly report funders and
medication providers as having no involvement in trial conduct or
decision making.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews
Reviews of controlled studies of cytisine have focused upon its
potential as an established and affordable aid to smoking cessation
(Etter 2006; Etter 2008; Tutka 2005; Tutka 2006; Tutka 2008). Many
of the early cytisine studies excluded from this review are discussed
and evaluated in Etter 2006, who concluded that cytisine may be
effective for smoking cessation. A systematic review and network
meta-analysis (Leaviss 2014), compared the benefits and costeffectiveness of cytisine (2 trials: Vinnikov 2008; West 2011), with
varenicline (21 trials). While the analysis found both treatments to
be effective for smoking cessation, cytisine delivered more qualityadjusted life-years at a lower cost than varenicline. Cytisine was
also associated with lower rates of headache and nausea than
varenicline. Our analyses on harms, using direct evidence, found
lower rates of nausea, but did not find evidence of difference in
rates of headache. A recent review of cytisine found similar results
to ours, though with a slightly higher point estimate for smoking
cessation (Tutka 2019). This is likely because they had broader
inclusion criteria than our review, and included studies with shorter
follow-up periods.
A Cochrane overview and network meta-analysis of a number of
pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation assessed 12
Cochrane Reviews published to November 2012 (Cahill 2013), and
therefore drew on the previous version of this review. Comparisons
between varenicline, bupropion and single-treatment NRT found
varenicline to be superior to both treatments (OR 1.59, 95% credible
interval 1.29 to 1.96 and OR 1.57, 95% credible interval 1.29 to
1.91, respectively). Varenicline demonstrated comparable benefits
for smoking cessation to combination NRT (OR 1.06, 95% credible
interval 0.75 to 1.48), but the number of NRT trials informing
this comparison was low (9 trials). This review is currently being
updated (Lindson 2022). A 2012 network meta-analysis (Mills 2012),
comparing high-dose and combination NRT versus varenicline and
versus bupropion across 146 RCTs, found varenicline (11 trials) to be
superior to placebo and to bupropion at all time points, and similar
in benefits for smoking cessation to standard and to high-dose NRT,
in line with our findings. A more recent systematic review with
network meta-analysis reported similar findings to ours, reporting
a benefit from varenicline compared with placebo (OR 2.69, 95%
CI 2.27 to 3.19), bupropion (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.81), and
standard-dose NRT (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.65; Thomas 2020).
However, they did not find evidence of increased rates of serious
adverse events amongst those randomised to receive varenicline
compared with placebo (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34), contrary to
the increased risk we detected. This may be due to their choice of

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

a random-effects rather than fixed-effect model for their analysis.
They did not find clear evidence of a difference in cardiac serious
adverse events (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25) and neuropsychiatric
serious adverse events (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.21), which is in line
with our findings.
An earlier systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 RCTs
(10,761 participants) by the same team assessed the risk of
neuropsychiatric adverse events among users of varenicline
(Thomas 2015). In line with our findings, the authors found no
clear evidence of an increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide
(Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.57), suicidal ideation
(Peto OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.20), depression (Peto OR 0.96,
95% CI 0.75 to 1.22) or death (Peto OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.38)
associated with varenicline. Lee 2016 compared cardiovascular
serious adverse event rates between people randomised to receive
varenicline or placebo. They did not find evidence of increased
risk of cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.72
to 1.49) in 38 trials of 12,706 people. This result was consistent
among cardiovascular (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.89) and noncardiovascular patients (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.64).

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Implications for practice
• Cytisine is likely to help more people to quit smoking than
placebo or no medication.
• Varenicline at standard dosage (1.0 mg twice a day) increased
the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation by more
than two-fold compared with placebo. We did not find evidence
that varenicline is less effective in any of the specific populations
we investigated.
• Varenicline is more effective at helping people to quit smoking
than bupropion, or a single form of nicotine replacement
therapy, and may be as effective as or more effective than dualform nicotine replacement therapy.
• People taking varenicline are probably more likely to experience
serious adverse events than those not taking it, and while
there may be increased risk of cardiac serious adverse events
and decreased risk of neuropsychiatric serious adverse events,
evidence was compatible with both benefit and harm.
• Cytisine may lead to fewer people reporting serious adverse
events than varenicline. There may be a benefit from
varenicline for quitting smoking, however further evidence
could strengthen this finding or demonstrate a benefit from
cytisine.

Implications for research
• Future trials should test the effectiveness and safety of cytisine
compared with varenicline and other pharmacotherapies, and
should also test variations in dose and duration.
• There is limited benefit to be gained from more trials testing the
effect of standard dose varenicline compared with placebo for
smoking cessation.
• Further varenicline trials should test the effect of variations in
dose and duration and preloading varenicline before quitting,
and may be useful in specific populations and settings where
there is a plausible rationale that the effect may differ.

Study design: double-blind placebo-controlled RCT
Dates conducted: March 2010 - June 2012

Participants

525 adult smokers, aged 18-75, smoking at least 10 CPD, motivated to quit, diagnosed with unipolar
MDD without psychotic features. 37% male, mean age 46, average CPD at baseline 22, mean FTND 5.9.
Allocated to varenicline (256) or placebo (269)
Exclusion criteria: current or past diagnosis of dementia, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
other psychotic disorder, bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder. People with antisocial, schizotypal, or
any other personality disorder severe enough to compromise their ability to comply with the study requirements
Current use of either bupropion or nortriptyline

Interventions

• Varenicline 1 mg x 2/day, titrated for first week
• Placebo inactive tablets, same regimen
All participants received manual-guided SC support, telephone support and one-to-one 10-min counselling by the same person where possible. Participants in both groups could reduce the dosage if they
wished
TQD was set for week 1 visit

13, 16, 24, 32, 40, 52 (or early termination); phone calls at weeks 14, 20, 28, 36, 44 and 48. Weekly pill
counts to assess adherence
Safety data were reviewed regularly by an external independent data safety monitoring committee
Outcomes

Primary: CO-confirmed CAR for weeks 9-12
Secondary: CO-confirmed CAR for weeks 9-24, 9-52; 7-day PPA at weeks 12, 24, 52; AEs and SAEs
Verification: CO < 10 ppm

Support for judgement

Random sequence generation (selection bias)

Low risk

"Eligible participants were randomly assigned to varenicline or placebo in a
1:1 ratio by using a computer generated, 4-block randomization scheme at
each site."

Allocation concealment
(selection bias)

Low risk

"Randomization was stratified by antidepressant medication use at baseline (any vs. none) and baseline Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS) score (11 vs. 11) (32). Investigators obtained participant identification
numbers and randomized study drug assignments by using a Web-based or
telephone call-in computerized drug management system."

Blinding (performance
bias and detection bias)
All outcomes

Low risk

"The study drug was supplied in blinded bottles by the sponsor to the study
sites, where they were dispensed according to computerized instructions."

Incomplete outcome data
(attrition bias)
All outcomes

Low risk

68.4% of varenicline group completed study (lost 15.6% in treatment and 16%
in follow-up); 66.6% of placebo group completed study (lost 21.9% in treatment and 11.5% in follow-up)

Selective reporting (reporting bias)

Interventions

• Varenicline 1 mg x 2/day, titrated for first week
• Placebo inactive tablets, same regimen
All participants received 15-min SC counselling at each visit. CO tested and pill counts at each visit. Participants in both groups could reduce the dosage if they wished.
TQD was set for week 2 onwards (i.e. full dosage reached)
Treatment period was 12 weeks. Weekly pill counts to assess adherence
Safety data were reviewed blind monthly by an external independent data safety and monitoring board
(DSMB)

Outcomes

Primary: 7-day PPA, CO-verified, at 12 weeks
Secondary outcomes: 7-day PPA at 24 weeks; CA at 12, 24 weeks

Study began as nortriptyline vs bupropion; 3 months later, 19 people had been
recruited to bupropion and 18 to placebo; nortriptyline was replaced as the
target treatment by varenicline. The nortriptyline phase group (cohort 1) had
19 days of medication and 3 counselling sessions before TQD, whereas varenicline phase group (cohort 2) had 12 days of medication and 2 counselling sessions before TQD. No differences were found between the 2 cohorts, nor between overall findings and cohort 2 findings. Study authors therefore combined both groups into a single study cohort for analysis.

Participants

1246 smokers, aged 18–65 years old and reported smoking ≥ 10 CPD for ≥ 6 months (verified with exhaled CO > 10 ppm). 44% female, mean age 46, baseline average CPD 18

Interventions

• Placebo pill + placebo patch
• Nicotine patch + placebo pill - 11 weeks of patches to match the duration of varenicline after the TQD:
21 mg (6 weeks), 14 mg (2 weeks), and 7 mg (3 weeks)
• Varenicline + placebo patch - 12 weeks (including 1 week before the TQD), 2 x 1 mg/day (titrated for
first week)
Participants were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio, by NMR group. All participants received interactive behavioural support. This included 1 in-person session pre-quit, and 4 x 15-min follow-up telephone calls.

Outcomes

Primary: 7-day PPA at EoT (week 11) to estimate the pharmacological effect by NMR group during the
medication period. Abstinence was biochemically verified with exhaled CO < 8 ppm.
Secondary end points were side-effects, withdrawal symptoms, and 6-month and 12-month quit rates

Rose 2013
Study characteristics
Methods

Country: USA
Setting: Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC
Aim: "Given the safety and tolerability profile of nicotine replacement therapy, our rationale in this
study was to use nicotine replacement therapy as an initial line of treatment, and then identify early on
which smokers are unlikely to benefit from nicotine alone"
Study design: randomised double-blind parallel-arm adaptive treatment trial in 2 phases
Dates conducted: not stated

Participants

606 adult smokers, motivated to quit, aged 18-65, mean CPD 10+ for 3 years, expired CO level 10+ ppm.
46% women, 63% white, mean CPD 21.7, mean FTND 5.8. Participants could receive up to USD 320 for
study participation

Interventions

2-phase study
All participants seen weekly for 2 weeks before TQD, and attended 4-6 sessions after the TQD. At each
session, participant received brief (< 15 min) support, + clinical trial materials. Smoking diaries, expired
CO, withdrawal symptoms and reports of AEs were collected each time. Participants were recontacted
at 6 months, and those reporting abstinence were invited to return to give a CO sample
All participants were given open-label active NRT patch, either 42 mg/day (baseline CO > 30 ppm) or 21
mg/day (baseline CO < 30 ppm) for 2 weeks; dose reductions allowed if side effects dictated. At 1 week,
participants were classified as 'responders' (reduced ad lib smoking by > 50%, CO-verified) or 'non-responders' (< 50%)
• Phase 1 (12 weeks)
◦ Non-responders only (N = 371-36 who withdrew, = 335) allocated to:
▪ double-blind varenicline, stopping NRT (N = 112)
▪ double-blind augmentation of NRT with bupropion (N = 109)
▪ continuation on open-label NRT alone (N = 114)
◦ All participants received dummy (placebo) versions of the other 2 treatments as well as their own
active treatment.
• Phase 2
◦ 235 responders after week 1 assessed at 1st week after TQD (week 3). Lapsers (N = 105) were assigned a 2nd TQD 1 week later, and were allocated to the same 3 double-blind treatment conditions as Phase 1 non-responders.
▪ double-blind varenicline, stopping NRT (N = 36)
▪ double-blind augmentation of NRT with bupropion (N = 34)
▪ continuation on open-label NRT alone (N = 35)
Non-lapsers (N = 130) remained on open-label NRT throughout study duration
All participants received dummy (placebo) versions of the other 2 treatments as well as their own active treatment.
47 participants were excluded from the analysis (27 Phase 1, 20 Phase 2) because of using contra-indicated medications during the study or failing to meet other entry requirements. 1 individual died before EoT, and 1 was excluded for extreme CO change from the mean sample range

Outcomes

Primary: CAR at weeks 8-11
Secondary: CA from TQD for 11 weeks (EoT); 7-day PPA at 6 months: CA from TQD to 6 months
Validation: CO ≤ 10 ppm
AEs and SAEs (reported, but not by treatment group)

Setting: 27 research centres
Aim: to test efficacy and safety of varenicline in smokers with COPD
Dates conducted: May 2006-April 2009
Study design: double-blind placebo-controlled RCT

Participants

504 adult smokers with mild-to-moderate COPD, aged 35+, smoking 10+ CPD, motivated to quit; allocated to varenicline (250), or placebo (254). 62% men, mean age 57, CPD 24-25, FTND score 5.9-6.2
Treatment groups were comparable at baseline
Exclusion criteria: standard pharmacotherapy trial criteria, + treatment with systemic corticosteroids
or hospitalised for COPD in previous 4 weeks

Interventions

• Varenicline 1.0 mg x 2/day for 12 weeks, preceded by 1 week titrated dose
• Placebo tablets as above
Both groups received SC educational booklet, + brief (≤ 10 min) counselling at weekly clinic visits
throughout treatment phase, and phone call 3 days post-TQD. At each visit smoking status reported
and CO verified; throughout treatment and at week 52 lung function, respiratory symptoms, weight,
blood pressure, pulse, temperature, ECGs, haematology and serum chemistry assessed, + AEs
Follow-up phase: smoking status + CO measured at weeks 13, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52; counselling and
self-reported status by phone at weeks 14, 20, 28, 36 and 44

Outcomes

Primary outcome: CO-validated CAR at weeks 9-12
Secondary outcomes: CO-validated CAR at weeks 9-52 and 9-24; 7-day PPA at weeks 12, 24 and 52
Other outcomes: AEs; SAEs; weight change
Validation was by expired CO ≤ 10 ppm
Cessation analyses were ITT (all participants randomised), while tolerability and safety analyses were
based only on those known to have used the intervention drug (N = 499). Attrition was 17% in the
varenicline group and 24% in the placebo group during treatment phase, and 29% varenicline and 38%
placebo who did not complete the study. This includes 2 deaths in the varenicline group and 1 in the
placebo group

Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: RCT
Country: Turkey
Setting: outpatient SC clinic in a hospital
Recruitment method: patients who presented at the SC outpatient clinic were included in the study on
a voluntary basis

Participants

300 participants randomised; average age: 45.8 in those who stopped smoking and 40.8 in those who
continued smoking; average boxes of cigarettes per year: 23.62 in those who stopped smoking and
23.26 in those who continued smoking; mean FTND: 5.9 in those who stopped smoking and 6.7 in those
who continued smoking

Interventions

• Bupropion 150 mg/day, started a week before the quit day and continued from day 1-3, raised to 300
mg daily on day 4, with this dose maintained until the end of week 12
• Varenicline 0.5 mg daily, raised to 1 mg daily at day 4, then to 2 mg daily at day 8, with this dose maintained until the end of week 12
• NRT: administered using either a nicotine patch or nicotine gum, or a combination of both. Nicotine
patches were used in their 3 forms containing 21, 14 and 7 mg of nicotine, and in cases of excessive
nicotine craving, 2 mg nicotine gum was used. For each dose of nicotine patches, 4 weeks of administration in decreasing doses was recommended. The nicotine gum was started between 12 and 24
doses (2 mg) a day and gradually decreased.

Outcomes

• SC: definition not specified; measured at 24-28 weeks from study start
• AEs: measured for unspecified period

Quote: “no adverse event was reported during the study”. This is highly unlikely to be correct when considering standard definitions of AEs. There is no
explanation of how AEs were assessed in this study. In addition, the wording
of the paper makes the final follow-up slightly unclear. After discussion we
judged final follow-up to be 24-28 weeks from study start, although quit rates
are higher than would be expected at this time point.

Term

Definition

Abstinence

A period of being quit, i.e. stopping the use of cigarettes or other tobacco products.
May be defined in various ways; see also: point prevalence abstinence; prolonged abstinence; continuous/sustained abstinence

Biochemical verification

Also called 'biochemical validation' or 'biochemical confirmation'
A procedure for checking a tobacco user's report that he or she has not smoked or used tobacco. It
can be measured by testing levels of nicotine or cotinine or other chemicals in blood, urine, or saliva, or by measuring levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled breath or in blood.

Bupropion

A pharmaceutical drug originally developed as an antidepressant, but now also licensed for smoking cessation; trade names Zyban, Wellbutrin (when prescribed as an antidepressant)

Carbon monoxide (CO)

A colourless, odourless, highly poisonous gas found in tobacco smoke and in the lungs of people
who have recently smoked, or (in smaller amounts) in people who have been exposed to tobacco
smoke. May be used for biochemical verification of abstinence.

Cessation

Also called 'quitting'
The goal of treatment to help people achieve abstinence from smoking or other tobacco use, also
used to describe the process of changing behaviour.

Continuous abstinence

Also called 'sustained abstinence'

(Continued)

A measure of cessation often used in clinical trials involving avoidance of all tobacco use since the
quit day until the time the assessment is made. The definition occasionally allows for lapses. This is
the most rigorous measure of abstinence.
'Cold turkey'

Quitting abruptly, and/or quitting without behavioural or pharmaceutical support.

Craving

A very intense urge or desire (to smoke)
See: Shiffman 2004

Dopamine

A neurotransmitter in the brain that regulates mood, attention, pleasure, reward, motivation and
movement

Efficacy

Also called 'treatment effect' or 'effect size'
The difference in outcome between the experimental and control groups

Harm reduction

Strategies to reduce harm caused by continued tobacco/nicotine use, such as reducing the number
of cigarettes smoked, or switching to different brands or products, e.g. potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), smokeless tobacco

Lapse/slip

Terms sometimes used for a return to tobacco use after a period of abstinence. A lapse or slip
might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be
regained. Some definitions of continuous, sustained or prolonged abstinence require complete abstinence, but some allow for a limited number or duration of slips. People who lapse are very likely
to relapse, but some treatments may have their effect by helping people recover from a lapse.

nAChR

Neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
Areas in the brain that are thought to respond to nicotine, forming the basis of nicotine addiction
by stimulating the overflow of dopamine

Nicotine

An alkaloid derived from tobacco, responsible for the psychoactive and addictive effects of smoking

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)

A smoking cessation treatment in which nicotine from tobacco is replaced for a limited period by
pharmaceutical nicotine. This reduces the craving and withdrawal experienced during the initial
period of abstinence while users are learning to be tobacco-free. The nicotine dose can be taken
through the skin, using patches, by inhaling a spray, or by mouth using gum or lozenges.

Outcome

Often used to describe the result being measured in trials that is of relevance to the review. For example smoking cessation is the outcome used in reviews of ways to help smokers quit. The exact
outcome in terms of the definition of abstinence and the length of time that has elapsed since the
quit attempt was made may vary from trial to trial.

Pharmacotherapy

A treatment using pharmaceutical drugs, e.g. nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion

Point prevalence abstinence
(PPA)

A measure of cessation based on behaviour at a particular point in time, or during a relatively brief
specified period, e.g. 24 hours, 7 days. It may include a mixture of recent and long-term quitters. cf.
prolonged abstinence, continuous abstinence

Prolonged abstinence

A measure of cessation that typically allows a 'grace period' following the quit date (usually of
about two weeks), to allow for slips/lapses during the first few days when the effect of treatment
may still be emerging.
See: Hughes 2003

Relapse

A return to regular smoking after a period of abstinence

Secondhand smoke

Also called passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROTOCOL AND REVIEW
For this update we did some restructuring of the meta-analyses and summary of findings tables to better present the evidence available,
including adding analyses of adverse events for comparisons of varenicline with other pharmacotherapies. We excluded previously
included studies as these studies recruited already-abstinent participants (Evins 2014; Tonstad 2006; Tønnesen 2013; NCT00828113), and
because follow-up was under six months (Hajek 2015). We also excluded Brandon 2011; Ebbert 2011b; Faessel 2009; Fagerström 2010;
Garza 2011; Hughes 2011; McClure 2013; Meszaros 2013; Mitchell 2012, which had previously been included for data on harms only but do
not meet all inclusion criteria.

Abstract
Introduction: Indigenous North Americans have the highest cigarette smoking prevalence among all racial and ethnic groups in the United
States. We seek to identify effective components of smoking cessation interventions in Indigenous people in the United States associated with
favorable cessation outcomes.
Methods: A review of literature studying smoking cessation interventions in Indigenous North Americans (American Indians and Alaska Natives)
from January 2010 through August 2021 was completed. The primary objective of this study was to identify components of interventions associated with positive smoking cessation outcomes in Indigenous people. The studies identified were synthesized in a meta-narrative approach.
Results: Ten studies out of 608 titles were included (6 randomized trials, 2 single-arm studies, 1 cohort study, and 1 prospective observational
study). Five categories of smoking cessation interventions were identified; phone or web-based tools, culturally-tailored interventions, the inclusion of Indigenous study personnel, pharmaceutical cessation aids, and behavioral health interventions. Phone and web tools, cultural tailoring,
and inclusion of Indigenous personnel conditions inconsistently influenced smoking cessation. Pharmaceutical aids were viewed favorably
among participants. Individualized behavioral counseling sessions were effective at promoting smoking cessation, as was input from local
communities in the planning and implementation phases of study.
Conclusion: A successful smoking cessation intervention in Indigenous North Americans includes Tribal or community input in intervention
design and implementation; should provide individualized counseling sessions for participants, and offer access to validated smoking cessation
tools including pharmacotherapy.
Implications: This study identifies a paucity of smoking interventions utilizing standard of care interventions in Indigenous North Americans.
Standard of care interventions including individualized cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy were effective at promoting cessation. The
use of novel culturally tailored cessation interventions was not more effective than existing evidence-based care with the exception of including
Tribal and local community input in intervention implementation. Future smoking cessation interventions in Indigenous North Americans should
prioritize the use of standard of care cessation interventions.

Introduction
Smoking prevalence in North American Indigenous people (American Indians and Alaska Natives) is the highest of
any race or ethnicity in the United States, estimated to be
as a high as 42.1% nationally by the Centers for Disease
Control.1–5 Smoking commercial tobacco products is known
to increase morbidity and mortality.6,7 Smoking in Indigenous
North Americans has also been recognized as a contributor to disparities in cancer prevalence, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality.2,6,8,9 There are over five million
Indigenous North Americans in the United States represented
by 574 federally recognized Tribal communities, with roughly
54% of the population residing in rural areas.1,5,10 The cause
of prominent smoking prevalence in this population is complex and multifactorial with variability among the diverse

Tribal communities in the United States and Canada.2–4,11,12
In addition to social factors influencing smoking behaviors in
the general population such as social determinants of health,
stable housing, transportation, medical literacy, and healthcare access, there are multiple unique factors contributing
to smoking behaviors in Indigenous North Americans.2,9,13,14
Tobacco is viewed by many Tribes as a traditional plant with
spiritual, medicinal, and cultural significance.3,15–17 The important role of traditional tobacco remains important for
many communities today.3,15–17 Historical trauma due to colonization remains a contributor to adverse health outcomes
in modern Indigenous people.14,18,19 Colonization lead to tremendous loss of life, land, language, and cultural practice and
identity in every Indigenous Nation in the United States. The
health impacts of this intergenerational trauma today can be

Materials and Methods
Eligibility Criteria
The target population was individuals over age 18 who
identified as American Indian, Alaska Native, Indigenous or
First Nations. If the primary population studied was not
explicitly Indigenous, but a subset of the cohort included
an Indigenous population, these studies were included.
Studies conducted in the United States and Canada were
included. Interventions conducted from 2010 through
most current publications were included in primary search
conducted January 22, 2020 with subsequent update in
search completed August 2, 2021. Languages included were
English and French. Ahead of print studies were considered
if contacted authors released data for analysis. Authors of
studies meeting criteria without specific Indigenous results
were contacted to determine if an Indigenous subgroup analysis was completed. Randomized controlled trials, qualitative studies, cohort studies, and retrospective studies were
included. If pediatric patients were targeted in the cohort
but there were individuals over age 18, these trials were
included. Trials limited to pediatric patients under age 18
were excluded. A review protocol registration was created
for this study and is under review with PROSPERO, record ID number 271710. The data underlying this article
are available in the article and in its online Supplementary
Material.

Literature Search
A comprehensive literature search of several databases from
inception to January 22, 2020, limited to English language,
was conducted. Databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R)
and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations and Daily, Ovid APA PsycINFO, Ovid EBM Reviews
– Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid EBM
Reviews – Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid
Embase and Scopus. On August 2, 2021, the search was
updated and re-run to include French language. A new strategy was created and run in the CINAHL (EbscoHOST) database from inception to August 2, 2021 and included both

English and French language. The search strategies were
designed and conducted by an experienced librarian (LCH)
with input from the study’s investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for
relevant studies. Upon screening, case reports, case series, and
review articles were excluded. The full search strategy listing
all search terms used and how they are combined is available
in Appendix 1, Supplementary Material.

Study Selection and Data Collection
Two independent reviewers (AR and AK) selected the studies and completed a critical appraisal with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (CCK). Search terms were created
to identify interventions intended to promote smoking cessation. Data were abstracted utilizing Covidence.org.25 Data
abstracted included study design, demographics, enrollment,
cessation end points, retention, and efficacy data. Intervention
details were also abstracted.

Methodological Quality Assessment
Randomized trials were assessed for risk of bias with the
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.26 Cohort studies were evaluated
with the Newcastle-Ottawa Assessment Scale.27 The Tool for
Methodological Risk of Bias in Case Reports and Case Series
was utilized to evaluate single arm studies.28

Definitions
Smokers were defined as consumers of commercial inhaled
combustible tobacco products. This study was designed to
capture specifically cigarette use, although cigar smokers and
electronic cigarette device users were considered smokers
for the purpose of this study. Exclusive users of chewing tobacco were not included. Ceremonial tobacco use was not
considered smoking.
The primary outcome examined by this review was cessation from smoking commercial tobacco products. Smoking
cessation was defined as abstinence from commercial cigarette smoking. Valid methods for the definition of smoking
cessation were patient self-report, biochemically confirmation (exhaled carbon monoxide, salivary cotinine, urinary
cotinine, and other evidence-based biologic markers), and
provider collected cessation information. The minimum duration of smoking cessation considered valid for inclusion in
this review were those defining cessation as greater than 24 h
of abstinence.29,30 This duration was utilized to minimize early
exclusion of studies in the screening process. Duration of cessation and method for confirming cessation as defined for
each study was recorded. Self-report and biomarker cessation
confirmation methods were considered valid for the purposes
of this review.31 When reported in primary literature, attitudes
regarding smoking cessation interventions were reviewed.
Behavioral cessation interventions were considered any
counseling intervention involving interaction with study
personnel or a healthcare practitioner regarding promotion of smoking cessation. Behavioral interventions could be
conducted in an individual or group setting.
There is no standard definition of a culturally tailored tobacco cessation intervention. We considered an intervention
to be culturally tailored if either of the following conditions
was met; (1) any existing cessation intervention modified
to include Indigenous beliefs, language, or specific Tribal
stories or (2) a novel cessation tool created with integrated
Indigenous beliefs, language, or specific Tribal stories.

measured by disparities as wide as mental health and stress
coping indexes, substance use and abuse, structural racism,
lifespan, and even epigenetic measures of methylation and
stress.14,18-21
Cessation interventions created for the general public not
only do not acknowledge the traditional role of tobacco in
Indigenous communities, but also create a negative image of
tobacco that is incongruent with traditional views of tobacco
for many Indigenous people.12,14,15,22,23 Development of smoking cessation interventions specifically tailored to Indigenous
people has become an area of study in the past two decades.2,13
Examples of culturally tailored cessation interventions include
acknowledgement of the traditional role of tobacco, hiring
Indigenous study staff, and collaboration with Indigenous
communities. There remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of complex behavioral, community,
and combined pharmaceutical interventions to address smoking prevalence in Indigenous people.13 Our objective was to
conduct a systematic review of the literature to synthesize
current evidence regarding smoking cessation interventions
for Indigenous adults in North America with special attention towards culturally tailored interventions.24

Analysis

Methodological Quality Assessment

The primary outcome was smoking cessation. We pursued
a meta-narrative review approach examining complex
interventions that focused on determining which components
of the interventions are essential and/or necessary to promote smoking cessation. All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its
Supplementary Information files.

The six randomized trials were judged to have low risk of bias
for most domains; however, considering nature of interventions
blinding among groups was not possible for participants, and we
were unable to ascertain methods for blinding study staff in multiple trials.32–37 The two cohort studies had good methodological
quality.38,39 The two single arm had overall good quality, with potential ascertainment bias regarding the outcomes measures as
the primary concern.40,41 Details of the methodological quality
assessment are available in Appendix 2, Supplementary Material.
Due to heterogeneity in methodology with crossover of pharmaceutical cessation aids between control and intervention groups,
meta-analysis was not feasible.

Behavioral Health Interventions
Eight trials described behavioral health interventions to promote smoking cessation.32–37,42,43 There was heterogeneity
in methods of behavioral health interventions. Four studies
offered group sessions combined with individual counseling
sessions.32,34,37,42 Four offered only individual counseling sessions.33,35,36,43
Two randomized control trials enrolled patients in a culturally tailored group with individual counseling conditions
and pharmacotherapy, compared to a control condition with
similar nonculturally tailored interventions.32,37 There was no
difference in proportion of individuals who achieved smoking
cessation comparing control groups to the study groups in
either study, suggesting counseling was associated with cessation and not augmented by addition of cultural elements.
Two randomized control trials conducted by Patten et al.
utilized counseling interventions for pregnant Alaska Natives.

The first involved a culturally tailored counseling intervention compared to an evidence-based nonculturally tailored intervention, and the later compared a counseling intervention
including biomarker feedback compared to a group without
biomarker feedback.35,36 There was no difference in smoking cessation between control groups and novel behavioral
interventions, suggesting the use of counseling interventions
can promote cessation. One study implemented a counseling intervention consisting of individualized intensive case
management to address cardiovascular disease risk factors at
multiple Indian Health Service sites.43 Self-reported cigarette
smoking was reduced from 19.5% to 16.3% (p < .05). In a
study enrolling patients to one of 15 study conditions including various intensities of multiple interventions, frequent behavioral interventions were not found to be highly associated
with cessation.
In summary, individual counseling session interventions
were effective at promoting smoking cessation. None of the
four studies including combined group and individual counseling interventions reached significance at promoting smoking cessation.
Culturally Tailored Interventions
Eight studies were considered culturally tailored for the
purposes of this review. All eight studies considered culturally tailored included collaborative efforts with Tribal
communities in planning and implantation of interventio
ns.32–37,42,43 Three studies included a cultural activity incorporated in counseling sessions, such as berry picking or story
telling.32,37,42 Three utilized tailored multimedia tools including written materials, phone and text message contact, or
incentives without a specific cultural activity completed.33,35,38
Details of elements of culturally tailored interventions are
outlined in Appendix 4, Supplementary Material.
Two of the four prospective studies utilizing culturally
tailored interventions did not obtain significance when considering the primary endpoint of smoking cessation.32,33,35,37
Although D’Silva and colleagues demonstrated a favorable
cessation rate of 21.8%, the participants reported the most
useful aspect of the program was access to free pharmaceutical cessation aids.42 The authors of Choi et al. postulated inclusion of culturally relevant interventions may result in other
favorable outcomes, such as study retention.32 Retention
was not found to be improved in other studies with the addition of cultural elements to cessation interventions.37 Of
note, one study intentionally did not modify existing curriculum to the local tribal community to prevent singling out
Indigenous communities, potential stereotyping of substance
use, and allow generalization of intervention to communities
outside of the study population.34 Heterogeneity among
conditions including culturally tailored interventions and the
influence of unmeasured, external study factors, limit definitive conclusions regarding the effect of culturally tailored
interventions. Furthermore, only the study by D’Silva and
colleagues reported a participant perspective surrounding response to interventions.
In summary, collaboration with the local communities was
the most effective component of culturally tailored smoking
cessation interventions. Three of the eight studies including
input from Tribal or local communities reached significance
in accordance with primary outcome of smoking cessation.
Including a cultural activity was inconsistently associated
with smoking cessation.

Pharmaceutical Cessation Aid Interventions
Five studies supplied a pharmaceutical cessation aid or studied the effect of an existing prescription for a pharmaceutical
cessation aid.32,33,37,38 Appendix 3 (Supplementary Material)
outlines details of studies utilizing pharmaceutical cessation
aids.
In a study conducted by Dignan et al. randomizing
recruited patients to one of fifteen study conditions with four
interventions of varying intensity, conditions including NRT
were found to be associated with cessation.33 Although NRT
was found to be associated with cessation, this study had significant loss to follow up, with 16 of 254 patients remaining
at the conclusion of the 18-month study.33 In an observational cohort study of Indigenous individuals conducted by
Fu et al., smoking cessation was 14.1% for the Indigenous
cohort prescribed NRT, with cessation associated with a favorable perception of NRT, older age, and an adoption of a
home smoking ban.38 A single-arm, mixed methods, multisite study by D’Silva et al. included use of a free pharmaceutical cessation agent of choice in conjunction with a
culturally tailored cessation intervention.42 The self-reported
cessation rate at study conclusion was 21.8% with 67%
of participants using a pharmaceutical cessation aid (52%
varenicline, 42% NRT, 6% bupropion).42 Cessation data specific to participants using a pharmaceutical cessation aid was
not reported. A total of 47% of the participants completing
the study reported using a pharmaceutical cessation aid was
the most useful resource provided by the study.42 Two studies
conducted by Smith et al. and Choi et al. compared control
groups (standard of care counseling by a healthcare provider
and pharmacotherapy) to a culturally tailored counseling intervention with pharmacotherapy.32,37 Both studies did not
reveal significant differences in tobacco cessation between
the control and study cohorts when examining primary end
points.32,37 These findings support increasing access to pharmaceutical cessation aids free of cost to promote smoking
cessation.
In summary, although use of a pharmaceutical aid was associated with cessation, it is difficult to estimate the effect as
pharmaceutical agents were used in multiple study conditions.
The use of pharmaceutical cessation aids for participants
with a positive perception of these agents were effective in the
promotion of cessation. Access to free or low cost pharmaceutical smoking cessation aids was an effective methods of
promoting smoking cessation.

Indigenous Study Personnel
The involvement of Indigenous study personnel or counselors
from the community was noted in four of the studies.32,34,35,37
The trial piloted by Patten et al. included counseling by an
Alaska Native counselor.35 This trial failed to promote smoking cessation compared to a standard pregnancy cessation
counseling intervention. In Smith et al., counseling was offered
by the study coordinator, an enrolled tribal member.37 Smith
failed to reach significance in promoting greater cessation
than standard of care interventions. The study by Livingston
et al. partnered with school district superintendents, school
principals, teachers, social workers and local citizen of the
Cherokee nations, with each of these playing a pivotal role
in the intervention.34 While this intervention promoted alcohol and chewing tobacco cessation, smoking was not reduced
with this intervention. Choi et al. were the only to have
recruited an Indigenous group facilitator for their culturally
tailored intervention and a non-Indigenous facilitator for
their current best practice program.32 The study condition did
not reveal significance compared to the control in promoting
smoking cessation.
In summary, incorporating Indigenous study personnel as counselors or coordinators interfacing directly with
participants was not associated with smoking cessation superior to existing best practice interventions.

Discussion
There are insufficient randomized control trials and prospective interventions to address disparities in smoking in
Indigenous North Americans. We found only three studies
representing 3768 Indigenous individuals that were effective
at achieving smoking cessation.33,42,43 These studies were heterogenous, but commonalities included individual counseling sessions, access to validated smoking cessation tools, and
Tribal community collaboration in development and implementation of interventions. Seven studies representing 2545
Indigenous individuals did not result in significant smoking
cessation.32,34–39 Common challenges among all included studies were loss to follow up. This challenge has been previously
described in Indigenous populations due to a variety of factors,
including hesitancy to participate due to lack of Indigenous
representation by study physicians, living geographically far
from study sites with transportation challenges, fear of breach
in confidentiality, and lack of personal experience with the
disease being studied by study personnel.20,44,45 The role of historical trauma and negative experiences with past research
practices further influences the recruitment and retention of
Indigenous people in clinical research.19,46,47
Although novel smoking cessation interventions including a variety of culturally tailored interventions were
completed, they were inconsistently more effective than
control interventions at achieving the primary outcome of
smoking cessation. Considering secondary effects of culturally tailored interventions such as retention and patient satisfaction, there were again inconsistent benefits associated
with inclusion of culturally tailored interventions. Although
Choi et al. postulated a secondary benefit of cultural tailoring
would increase retention in studies, a similar study conducted
by Smith et al. had one of the lowest percentages of retention of the included studies in this review despite inclusion
of culturally tailored elements.32,37 Although participants in
D’Silva et al. found the use of cultural elements helpful, more
participants found free pharmaceutical cessation aids useful
to achieve cessation.42
Individual counseling sessions to promote smoking cessation are effective interventions to augment smoking cessation
counseling completed during a clinical encounter.48 There
is strong evidence suggesting use of individual counseling
is effective when completed without other interventions in
the general population, and moderate evidence suggesting
individualized counseling methods in addition to pharmacotherapy are effective at promoting cessation.48 In the
Indigenous population, individual counseling interventions
were effective when included in a smoking cessation program. Adding cultural elements to these interventions did
not promote higher rates of smoking cessation compared to
studies with a control. These findings suggest promoting evidence based counseling interventions with higher uptake in
Indigenous North Americans may be required to promote
greater rates of smoking cessation. Access to evidence based
counseling interventions for this population requires further
interventions including addressing social determinants of
health, such as equitable care promoting referral to cessation
programs, transportation for patients in rural settings, and
other social barriers.9
Collaboration with Tribal communities to develop
interventions resulted in improved smoking cessation
outcomes among studies included. These findings suggest

Telephone Calls, Text Messages, and Online Interventions
Phone, text, and online media interventions were used in five
of the included studies. Four studies included phone contact
including use of text messages, and one examined web based
or phone Quitline use.32,33,35,36,39
Phone calls were utilized by Patten et al. in 2012 as part
of an outreach intervention to rural Alaska Native women,
and as a component of a biomarker feedback pilot intervention in 2019.36 Neither of these interventions reached
significance for the primary outcome of smoking cessation
as defined by each study protocol.35,36 Choi et al. provided
telephone-based motivational counseling as an adjunct to
in-person group-based counseling,32 without reaching significance for the primary outcome. Dignan et al. used mobile
health (mHealth) text messages to provide education and
support.33 Participants received up to four messages, including a morning query that required a response. This study
also failed to reach significance at promoting cessation as
the primary outcome. Neri et al. found Quitline users were
1.26 (1.00–1.58) times more likely to achieve smoking cessation than those using web-based interventions.39 While
the number of participants was large (n = 4086), only 2%
of all Quitline users (n = 2238), and less than 1% of web
users (n = 1848) self-identified as Indigenous. Telephonebased interventions did not positively impact participation
or retention. Retention was a more significant issue in the
telephone-based current best practice arm than the culturally tailored intervention arm in the trial conducted by Choi
et al.32 In one of the studies by Patten et al., participation
did not increase when study coordinators offered telephone
counseling to a group of pregnant women who did not have
time to commute to their in-person visits.35
In summary, there is insufficient evidence to support the
use of phone and text message interventions in Indigenous
populations. The postulated benefit of retention was not
supported by evidence.

collaborative research methodologies in Indigenous
populations result in favorable smoking cessation outcomes.
Conducting studies in the framework of community based
participatory research (CBPR) represents a methodology
with prior success in Indigenous communities.49,50 CBPR
is a research method involving community members as
stakeholders in the research process.50 By involving local
communities in planning and implementation, experiential
knowledge from the community can enhance interventions.
Limitations in recommending community collaboration
include heterogeneity in populations examined among
included studies. Some studies were conducted in collaboration with one specific Tribe, such as the intervention
conducted by D’Silva et al.42 Language and Tribal stories
were included in crafting interventions, limiting generalizability to other Indigenous communities. In the study
conducted by Moore et al., use of a standardized counseling framework to address cardiovascular risk factors
across multiple IHS facilities promoted smoking cessation.43 This suggests increasing access to validated tools
promoting smoking cessation may be sufficient to promote
changes in health outcomes. These interventions may have
insufficient uptake in Indigenous communities due to the
influence of societal and social factors. The importance of
assessing the needs of communities prior to implementation of an intervention are demonstrated by wide regional
and Tribal variability in cigarette smoking prevalence. For
example, adults of Northern Plains Tribes have estimated
smoking prevalence in adults of 44%, compared to 21%
of adults of Southwestern Tribes.4,11,51 There are further
regional variations in Indigenous adults residing in urban
settings. An estimated 40% of Urban Indigenous people in
Oakland, California smoke commercial tobacco products.12
Conducting a thorough community needs assessment prior
to design and implementation is critical to meet the unique
needs of urban, rural, and reservation based Indigenous
North Americans.
Although interest in developing novel smoking cessation
interventions remains high, there are limitations in current
data describing the impact of standardized smoking cessation interventions in Indigenous communities. This review
demonstrates pharmacotherapy and standard of care counseling interventions are effective. None of the included studies focused on cessation maintenance or long-term tobacco use
outcomes. Longitudinal effects of these interventions following
study conclusion are unknown, and no study provided ongoing
support to maintain cessation after study conclusion. Despite
these limitations, there is evidence to support conducting a
community needs assessments and collaboration with local
communities when planning an intervention. An additional element of effective interventions included individualized plans
and meetings with participants. Future trials studying smoking cessation in the Indigenous population should include three
components based on current evidence, (1) community collaboration in planning and implementation of interventions and
(2) individual meetings with participants, and (3) increasing
access to standard of care smoking cessation interventions including pharmaceutical cessation aids.

Abstract
Introduction: Tobacco smoking rates in high-income countries are greater in rural, regional,
and remote (RRR) areas compared to cities. Yet, there is limited knowledge about
interventions targeted to RRR smokers. This review describes the effectiveness of smoking
cessation interventions for RRR smokers in supporting smoking abstinence.
Methods: Seven academic databases were searched (inception-June 2022) for smoking
Canada, or the United States, and short- (<6 months) or long-term (≥6 months) smoking

t

abstinence outcomes. Two researchers assessed study quality, and narratively summarised
findings.

Results: Included studies (n=26) were primarily randomised control (12) or pre-post (7)
designs, from the United States (16) or Australia (8). Five systems change interventions were
included. Interventions included cessation education or brief advice, and few included
nicotine monotherapies, cessation counselling, motivational interviewing, or cognitive

an

behavioural therapy. Interventions had limited short-term effect on RRR smoking abstinence,
decreasing markedly beyond 6-months. Short-term abstinence was best supported by

M

contingency, incentive, and online cessation interventions, and long-term abstinence by
pharmacotherapy.

d

Conclusions: Cessation interventions for RRR smokers should include pharmacotherapy and

pt
e

psychological cessation counselling to establish short-term abstinence, and identify effective
means of maintaining abstinence beyond 6-months. Contingency designs are a suitable
vehicle for psychological and pharmacotherapy support for RRR people who smoke, and

ce

intervention tailoring should be explicitly considered.
Implications: Smoking disproportionately harms RRR residents, who can encounter access

Ac

barriers to smoking cessation support. High-quality intervention evidence and outcome
standardisation are still required to support long-term RRR smoking abstinence.

INTRODUCTION
Smoking cessation is central to preventing chronic health conditions through reducing stroke
or acute myocardial infarction risk,1 improving cancer-related treatment and recovery
outcomes,2,3 and reducing overall mortality rates. High-income countries like Australia,
Canada, and the United States of America (USA) have well-resourced tobacco control
measures, aligned with WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control strategy.4
and remote (RRR) areas can have higher smoking rates compared to metropolitan areas.5,6 In

t

the United States, combined data (2007-14) showed higher current cigarette use in rural
(27.3%) compared to the urban (21.3%) areas.5 Australia, had an increasing daily age-

standardised daily smoking prevalence rates between major cities (12.8%), inner regional
(16.5%), and remote areas (19.6%) in 2017-18.7 Elsewhere, international prevalence
estimates also indicate disparities (e.g., rural Appalachia, 33%8; Canadian NorthwestTerritory, 25%9). Despite higher smoking rates in RRR areas, research shows that these

an

smokers are generally motivated to quit, with a high proportion having already made several
quit attempts.6,10

M

Best practice in smoking cessation support involves providing both behavioural
counseling and pharmacotherapy.11 Yet, surveys of rural smokers show a significantly lower

d

likelihood of smoking cessation advice provision compared to urban counterparts.12 Rural
residents more often face geographical and socioeconomic barriers to accessing smoking

pt
e

cessation support.13,14 As rural-living Indigenous peoples have higher all-cause mortality,15
and smoking rates than non-Indigenous peoples,16 this further underscores the need for

ce

increased RRR-specific interventions17
Limited evidence is available for the types of smoking cessation interventions

preferred and the delivery format (e.g., in-person, telehealth) for smokers residing in RRR

Ac

areas and their effectiveness.18 Preliminary studies indicate that telehealth and web-based
intervention modalities can reduce access barriers to evidence-based smoking cessation
support.18 There is a clear need to synthesise current literature specific to RRR smokers to
identify effective smoking cessation interventions. This review focuses on Australia, Canada,
and the USA, given their comparable economic systems, geographical size, and smoking
rates. This review aimed to describe the types of smoking cessation interventions for RRR
smokers, describe short (<6-months) and long-term (>6 months) smoking cessation

designating a cessation support person. As systems change interventions in this review (n=5)
used multiple components for which individual effects are difficult to interpret, these are
discussed in a separate section. Design and abstinence outcomes are presented in greater
detail in Supplements 2 and 3 and are discussed in the following sections.
Short-term abstinence. In a 6-week home-based program (Reynolds et al39),

t

Appalachian adolescents received financial vouchers for three webcam-verified daily carbon
monoxide (CO) samples indicating smoking abstinence. CO reductions were financially
reinforced in treatment, and timelines reinforced in the control condition. Treatment reduced
CO from baseline to end-of-treatment by more (4.4ppm, p<.0001) than did control (1.7ppm,
p=.06). Average daily cigarettes also decreased in both conditions, though no between-group
abstinence effects were found.

Online abstinence-contingent management was further supported with Appalachian
adults in a 6-week program reinforcing twice-daily CO samples, compared to non-reinforced

controls (Stoops et al28). An online display showed daily results, cumulative CO, and money
earned. Smokers in the contingency condition were significantly more likely than controls to

after week 1. Short-term abstinence was achieved but not maintained, and nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) was not restricted.
A separate program with pregnant Appalachian smokers compared 6-week online

financial-contingency management to five cessation phone counseling calls (Harris et al44).
Short-term CA from 3.5 to 5.5 months was supported via both contingency (14.3% to 28.6%)

Ac

and phone (10.0% to 20.0%), with online delivery considered feasible. This aligns with a
pharmacy-delivered program providing seven brief advice sessions to rural Australian female
smokers, with abstinence-contingent payments over 3 months (Breen et al34). This decreased
average daily cigarettes at week 1 (M=17.46, to M=2.60, p<.001), though CO-verified 7-day
PPA decreased from week 1 to 3-months post-enrolment (32.25% to 19.35%, untested).34
Long-term abstinence. Although most contingency-based interventions were shortterm abstinence focused, Harris et al44, assessed abstinence at three long-term points:
contingency (6.86, 8.05, 8.75 months), phone (6.45, 7.37, 8.19 months). Cotinine-verified 7day PPA decreased in the online contingency (28.6% to 14.3%, untested) but not phone
counseling condition (30.0% to 30.0%) from weeks 4 to 6 post-enrolment.

Training health providers
Short-term abstinence. A study training regional tobacco-treatment specialists to
provide preoperative smoking cessation support to Arkansan smokers found a large selfreported quit rate for patients completing the program, versus all patients (74.0% vs 42.0%)
(Sheffer et al46). Yet, this rate decreased for both participants and all patients three months
after discharge (42.0% vs 30.0%). A separate study at 20 healthcare sites delivered 6-sessions
(Sheffer et al47), returning a low 7-day PPA three months after intervention (ITT, 18.95%).

t

In a pre-post design study of an 8-week multi-component smoking cessation

intervention for rural smokers (Northridge et al36), health clinic staff and volunteers were
trained to integrate cessation support from the American Lung association into clinical
consultations. Program completers were significantly more likely than non-completers to
have quit smoking following intervention (AOR=7.98, 95%CI=4.87, 13.08).

Long-term abstinence. In Schorling et al37, church volunteers trained in stages-of-

an

change counselling and self-help smoking cessation material were compared to volunteers
trained in hypertension counseling (control) for supporting rural African American smokers

M

to quit in 70 clinics. Self-reported 30-day PPA was low for treatment (6.20%) and control
(9.60%) after 18-months intervention.

Long-term cessation was supported with smokers aged ≥16 years at two north-

western Australia Aboriginal health services (Marley et al38). Usual care (i.e., routine advice,
pharmacotherapy) was compared to usual care plus 12 Aboriginal-led counseling sessions
over 12 months. Self-reported 7-day PPA at 6 months post-enrolment did not differ between

ce

conditions (11.0% vs 9.0%). At 12 months post-enrolment, cotinine-verified 7-day PPA was
higher in the intervention group compared to controls (29.0% vs 8.0%), though not for ITT.

Ac

In Northridge et al36, having health providers deliver cessation support to Appalachian

smokers led to a self-reported quit rate of just 17% after 12 months. Low long-term
abstinence was also seen in Sheffer and Bannon47. Here, training specialists to deliver
tobacco dependence and relapse prevention CBT to Arkansan smokers produced comparably
low 7-day PPA after 12 months (24.27%) and lower for ITT.
Psychological/pharmacological combination
Short-term abstinence. Smoking abstinence was supported for Koori Australian
smokers in a program combining Aboriginal health worker led 3-week behavioural (group
education, Quitline referral and call, and doctor consultation, with NRT and buproprion

of relapse focused cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to rural low-SES Arkansan smokers

information.42 Three-week PPA was high for this priority population despite absent co-design
(19%), and no pharmacotherapy dosage description.
In the Northridge et al36, program for health provider delivered cessation support of
Appalachian smokers, both behaviour modification and eight weeks of free NRT or
buproprion were provided with follow-up group support. However, self-reported quitting was
higher in urban compared to rural (60.6% vs 51.4%, untested) smokers, with rural smokers

status (SES) Arkansan smokers led to a moderate 7-day PPA 3-months post intervention
(28.6%). Approximately 51.1% of participants used patches, with 15.9% using other
pharmacotherapy (e.g., bupropion).

Long-term abstinence. A study comparing pharmacological management to moderate
and high disease management conditions via motivational interviewing found no difference
in 7-day PPA at 24-months between conditions when self-reported (23.0% to 27.9%), and

an

cotinine verified (13.5% to 14.8%) (Ellerbeck et al26). Although difference was also not
apparent at 36 months, varenicline use predicted higher likelihood of 7-day PPA.43

M

In Gould and Watters’32, single-session CBT behaviour change training was provided to rural
smokers in primary care, covering cessation reasons, planning, pharmacology, and

d

pharmacotherapy. Follow-up 6-months post intervention found low self-reported (28.6%) and

biochemically verified (14.3%) quitting.

A further study compared integrated video telemedicine to telephone counselling for
smoking cessation by low SES rural Kansan smokers at primary care clinics.27 Similarly,

ce

counsellors combined motivational interviewing and CBT, with telemedicine participants
using clinic computers, and telephone participants their own device. Both conditions

provided pharmacological advice. More smokers in the telemedicine condition used cessation
medication (55.9% vs 46.1%), though dosage was not described. Cotinine verified 7-day ITT
PPA at 12 months did not differ between telemedicine and telephone (9.8% vs 12.0%).
In a 6-week program via Aboriginal health services,45 Aboriginal Australian smokers

in the Northern Territory, received either pharmacological aid (decreasing dosage NRT
patches plus brief advice) or brief advice only (i.e., quit planning). At 6-months post baseline,
CO-verified PPA was low in both conditions (3.0% vs 10.0%, untested), with NRT side
effects in 29% of patch users. The Northridge et al36 intervention also paired educational and
pharmacological intervention for health provider delivered cessation support. However,
short-term abstinence effects were not sustained at 12 months (53.1% to 17.0%). Long-term

less likely than urban to have quit. This supports Sheffer et al47, where six CBT quit sessions

abstinence was however supported by Sheffer and Bannon47, where six sessions of smoking
cessation CBT with a 4-week supply of NRT patches sustained abstinence at 12 months (CC,
24.27%), with self-efficacy a predictor of this.
Telehealth
Short-term abstinence. A behavioural intervention by Breen et al34 incorporated
telephone cessation support access. However, among those obtaining further support (74.2%),

single NRT, 37.0%) was not specified. In a separate study of rural and urban Canadian

us
cr

t

smokers comparing in-person health service support to delivery via telehealth,18 eight group
sessions were run over four months by psychologists addressing cessation education, selfmonitoring, and relapse prevention. Three months into the intervention, ITT CA did not differ
between on-site (27.3%) and telehealth (25.5%).

Short-term telehealth intervention feasibility was supported with pregnant

Appalachian smokers,44 when comparing web-based contingency management for smoking

an

cessation to a nurse-delivered phone counseling program. Feasibility of self-reported
smoking abstinence from 3.5 to 5.5 months was supported for both contingency (14.3%-

M

28.6%) and phone (10.0%-20.0%) conditions, given the small sample and untested
differences.

d

Telehealth video counselling also supported short-term smoking abstinence for rural
Australian smokers, via a program comparing one week of brief CBT and motivational

pt
e

interviewing with a trained quit advisor against telephone counseling.40 From baseline to four
months, 7-day PPA was higher for video (18.9%) than phone (12.7%) counselling. Short-

ce

term abstinence was also supported with rural US smokers using a mobile application
presenting eight sets of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) exercises.41 When

Ac

compared to a smoke-free guidance app for increasing quit motivation, the ACT app
produced higher 7-day PPA (26.0% vs 17.0%) and 30-day PPA (15.0% vs 9.0%) at 3 months.
Long-term abstinence. The ACT exercises mobile application tested with rural US

smokers above also suggested higher long-term abstinence outcomes over the smoke-free
guidance app for 7-day PPA at 12 months (35.0% vs 31.0%), and 30-day PPA at 12 months
(29.0% vs 25.0%), and CA at 12 months (15.0% vs 10.0%).41 Azor Hui et al43 showed also
that rural Kansan smokers receiving pharmacotherapy (NRT patch or buproprion), low
disease management, or high disease management pairing pharmacotherapy with
motivational interviewing had comparably low 7-day PPA 36 months after intervention
(5.3% vs 3.7% vs 4.3%). The Ellerbeck et al26 study comparing pharmacological to moderate

and high disease management did not support long-term abstinence, as 7-day PPA at 24months, was low in all three conditions, and lower again when cotinine-verified. Following
the 24-month intervention, smokers more often reported abstinence in the combined disease
management conditions compared to pharmacotherapy.

Education programs

Short-term abstinence. The Adams et al42 smoking cessation program delivered with
Koori Aboriginal Australian smokers included a short course education component with
Quitline support, and produced a 19% 3-week PPA post intervention.

In the Carlson et al18 study, telehealth educational intervention produced comparable
3-month CA to in-person at 3 months (25.5% vs 27.3%), suggesting high suitability for rural

an

smokers. Both approaches used education in self-monitoring, smoking behaviours, cessation
aids, withdrawal, stress, and relapse prevention.

M

Educational intervention also worked well with rural American teenagers,33
comparing multicomponent gender-specific sessions on smoking reasons, quit preparation,

d

addiction, and social supports, to brief generic sessions giving quit advice. From baseline to

pt
e

3-months post-intervention, CO-verified quitting was higher in the intervention than control
(8.33% vs. 1.67%). Verified quitting differences were not seen for females but not males,
with gender interaction lowering effectiveness for males. Finally, the Northridge et al36 study

ce

of rural American smokers described earlier used an educational component from an
American Lung Association program. Compared to smokers finishing in the first half of the

Ac

program, those finishing in the second half were more likely to report quitting postintervention.

Long-term abstinence. Bailey et al35 compared four brief psychoeducation sessions to

usual care in quitting for Appalachian pregnant smokers at prenatal practices. Sessions
considered environmental, social, and motivational factors for abstinence. Intervention lasted
from first antenatal visit to delivery, and abstinence at the end of the second trimester was
significantly higher when using psychoeducation (28.1% vs 9.8%).
Educational components were also present in Carlson et al18 within eight group
education sessions covering self-monitoring, smoking habits, withdrawal, stress management,
and relapse prevention, comparing in-person against telehealth intervention for rural

12 months in rural Kansan smokers did not differ between video consultation (9.8%) and

Canadian smokers. As noted earlier, abstinence did not differ between conditions at 6 or 12
months into the intervention, and effect of education could not be isolated.
In a brief behaviour-change intervention, Gould and Watters32 used CBT education on
quitting, pharmacological mechanisms, and cessation planning to support low self-reported
(28.6%) and verified (14.3%) abstinence at 6 months in rural Australian smokers.

Short-term abstinence. A small study of rural Australian general, surgical, and drug
treatment patients suggested feasibility of 8-week buproprion treatment for smoking
cessation.48 Two-months post-treatment commencement, self-reported PPA was moderatelyhigh (38.9%). Feasibility for short-term abstinence was also supported among Aboriginal

an

Australian and Torres Strait Islander smokers, when using single-session brief advice control
(health, quit readiness/planning) with 10-weeks of NRT.45 Participants had higher 6-month

M

verified PPA than did controls (15.0% vs 1.0%, untested), and more often reported reduction
tobacco use (76.0% vs. 51.0%). However, with low NRT compliance, feasibility only is

supported. Gould and Watters’32 study also provided smokers samples of patches, gum, or
lozenges, though NRT contribution to abstinence was unreported.

pt
e

Long-term abstinence. In Ellerbeck et al26, as described earlier, pharmacotherapy
alone (6-week NRT 21mg patch or 7-week buproprion 2x150mg) produced a lower 7-day

ce

PPA at 24 months when cotinine-verified, as combining pharmacotherapy with motivational
interviewing produced more long-term abstinence. Under the same parent study26 Azor Hui et

Ac

al43 found that recalcitrant (≥10 cigarettes daily) rural Kansan smokers had similarly low 7day PPA 12 months after the 24 month intervention whether using pharmacotherapy (5.3%)
or pharmacotherapy with counselling (3.7-4.3%).
Systems change interventions
Short-term abstinence. In a systems change program for Appalachian smokers
(Ferketich et al30), primary care clinic cessation support using physician education, support
staff, and telephone counseling was compared to providing physicians at four separate clinics
with a clinical practice reference, a patient cessation brochure, and Quitline referral
reminders. Physicians were educated to incorporate brief advice, pharmacotherapeutic and
support services information into clinical practice. Self-reported 7-day PPA at 3 months was

information, and healthcare professionals were provided brief advice training (5A model49).
This focused on benefits of quitting before surgery, and healthcare professionals shared
health benefits brochures with patients. At 12 months, there was no difference in the

At three-years post baseline, self-reported abstinence was no higher in the intervention

DISCUSSION
This review identifies several effective smoking cessation intervention approaches for

abstinence. Findings from this review suggested that intervention components that work well

us
cr
ip

t

with RRR populations are broadly consistent with those most effective with general

populations. However, as ‘rurality’ captures populations with very different characteristics
(e.g., pregnant women, Appalachian adolescents), interventions requires careful tailoring and
co-design to best support long-term smoking abstinence outcomes.

Contingency, incentive, and online smoking cessation approaches are most effective
in promoting short-term verified abstinence among RRR smokers, and can exceed phone

an

counselling in effectiveness.44 This is consistent with review findings that reward-focused
cessation interventions more strongly predict cessation in general, non-rural, populations.50

M

Additionally, as abstinence decreases after contingencies end,28,34,39 participant
retention is an essential consideration for online intervention success.28,34,39,44 Whilst we

d

found incentives to be effective only in the short-term, a recent Cochrane review supports

pt
e

their effectiveness for long-term cessation.51 However, this evidence is broader than RRR
populations, suggesting there may be a difference in contextual elements unique to RRR
populations and indicating the need for further exploration into factors such as the level of

ce

incentive, and potential role of self-incentive (e.g., deposit) in different settings. Improving
the usability of online interfaces is another way to supporting effectiveness. 28 As abstinence

Ac

can decrease more rapidly in online versus telephone-only interventions,44 trade-offs in
benefits should be considered in intervention design (e.g., accessibility). Behaviour change
program interfaces are a key means of tailoring interventions for RRR populations to account
for different needs (e.g., real-time input/monitoring).52
Telehealth interventions produced moderately-low short-term abstinence that was
comparable to in-person support.18 This is ideal for RRR people who smoke, where in-person
services may be less easily accessed, as phone counseling for smoking cessation can be
provided within systems change interventions.30 Yet, telehealth suitability for long-term
outcomes in such populations was less supported, with low abstinence,43 issues sustaining
abstinence,25 and potential cost barriers (e.g., integrated counselling).27 Despite this, online

RRR smokers in supporting short-term (<6 months) and long-term (≥6 months) smoking

and telehealth-based interventions are highly suited to RRR delivery as their design account
for environmental factors (e.g., distance), participation requirements (e.g., digital literacy),
and incorporate pharmacotherapy26 (e.g., via mail out NRT).
Pharmacotherapy paired with behavioural support is considered a first line cessation
treatment option.53 Yet, combining psychological and pharmacological approaches to
cessation with rural populations has mixed support, as community delivered and financially

research is needed to align these to RRR specific needs. Despite brief CBT and

pharmacotherapy advice being cost effective,32 there may be low benefit beyond 12 months,
to providing psychological support additional to NRT.26,36,43 More intensive CBT paired with
NRT may however help sustain abstinence long-term.47 A further alternative that has not yet
been tested is the role of electronic cigarettes in RRR adult smoking cessation,54 a current
research gap.

an

Training RRR health providers in smoking cessation support holds promise for shortterm, though not long-term, abstinence.46,47 Although this approach readily integrates into

M

clinical care, providers may not advise smokers to quit,24 instead offering printed resources to
support long-term abstinence.25 A key benefit is that this approach facilitates Aboriginal-led

d

cessation support for long-term abstinence.38,46

Educational interventions may support comparable short-term abstinence to other

approaches,18,29 though this is lower when verified.33,36 Despite this, such interventions are
readily delivered in clinical settings,30,36 and can benefit from considering gender,31,33

ce

pregnancy,29,35 and cultural42 factors. However, long-term abstinence was not well supported
for educational interventions (7.8% to 28%).18,24,25,31,32,35,37 Given this, it will be worthwhile

to consider how engagement with smoking cessation and abstinence education can be
sustained and scaled over time for RRR populations specifically.
Using pharmacotherapy alone had mixed evidence, as this was typically combined

with other intervention components. However, pharmacotherapy access can support shortterm smoking abstinence with behaviour modification,36 and by using buproprion alone.48
Long-term abstinence was not clearly supported for pharmacotherapy, though this may
reduce the amount of smoking.45 Using pharmacotherapy alone did not produce differing
abstinence to interventions that paired this with psychological components (e.g., CBT26,43).
Abstinence effects can subside long-term,36,47 and pharmacotherapy side effects are a barrier
to adherence.45 To address this, Mersha et al55 noted that physical and mental capability,

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ntr/ntad098/7203886 by guest on 24 June 2023

incentivised34 approaches produced similar outcomes to NRT with psychological support.47

perceptions of NRT and cessation, motivational and social factors need to be incorporated
into NRT approaches. This may extend to other forms of pharmacotherapy.
Future directions
Registering evaluation protocols is needed to better understand which RRR
populations are most suited to telehealth interventions, core needs and intervention tailoring
for smoking cessation support, how to design intervention components for these needs, and

intervention components to abstinence outcomes can then be isolated (e.g., systems

interventions),56 supporting evidence consolidation for RRR program and policy design.
Interventions showing promise include those using pharmacotherapy for short-term

abstinence, particularly finding cost-effective ways to address retention, adherence, and
scale-up barriers. Research into approaches such as pharmacotherapy (e.g., NRT, buproprion,
varenicline) is needed, as its delivery can promote relapse prevention, while meeting RRR
smokers’ access barriers.57 Interventions should also consider the relative benefits of

an

pharmacotherapy advice only versus pharmacotherapy provision, as some RRR populations
may have barriers to, for example, NRT access based on advice (e.g., relative social

disadvantage).There is a need to identify how to maintain smoking abstinence beyond 6months, by identifying RRR smoker intervention preferences,40 and characteristics of former

Although the search strategy captured a range of interventions, heterogeneity in

ce

design, content, and abstinence outcome measurement shows the need for standardised
evaluation protocols. For example, there could be more use of biochemical verification of
smoking abstinence.e.g.,59 Few studies provided NRT to smokers,60,61 or used motivational

Ac

interviewing,e.g.,26,27,35,43 or CBTe.g., 27,32,47 to improve outcomes.62 As only one telehealth
study was post-2016,34 more modern RRR telehealth studies will be included in further
reviews. Systems interventions, unspecified pharmacotherapy dosage,28,45 and small
samples48 complicate interpretation of abstinence outcomes. Despite these limitations, this
study provides a detailed overview of how smoking cessation interventions can be best
delivered with RRR populations.

Conclusions
Our review found that most interventions have limited short-term influence on RRR
smoking abstinence (<50.0%), with this decreasing markedly beyond the 6-month mark.
Interventions for RRR smokers should include pharmacotherapy paired with psychological
smoking cessation counseling (e.g., CBT) per recommendations,11 to establish and maintain
short-term abstinence. Interventions using contingency designs that monitor and reward RRR

Abstract
Background: Smoking is a leading cause of premature death globally. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of all-cause mortality
by 11%-34%. Smartphone app–based smoking cessation (SASC) interventions have been developed and are widely used. However,
the evidence for the effectiveness of smartphone-based interventions for smoking cessation is currently equivocal.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of smartphone app–based interventions
for smoking cessation.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of smartphone interventions for smoking
cessation based on the Cochrane methodology. An electronic literature search was performed using the Cochrane Library, Web
of Science, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases to identify published
papers in English or Chinese (there was no time limit regarding the publication date). The outcome was the smoking abstinence
rate, which was either a 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate or a continuous abstinence rate.
Results: A total of 9 randomized controlled trials involving 12,967 adults were selected for the final analysis. The selected
studies from 6 countries (the United States, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada, and Japan) were included in the meta-analysis
between 2018 and 2022. Pooled effect sizes (across all follow-up time points) revealed no difference between the smartphone
app group and the comparators (standard care, SMS text messaging intervention, web-based intervention, smoking cessation
counseling, or apps as placebos without real function; odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.56, P=.06, I2=73.6%). Based on the
subanalyses, 6 trials comparing smartphone app interventions to comparator interventions reported no significant differences in
effectiveness (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85-1.26, P=.74, I2=57.1%). However, the 3 trials that evaluated the combination of smartphone
interventions combined with pharmacotherapy compared to pharmacotherapy alone found higher smoking abstinence rates in
the combined intervention (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.38-2.33, P=.74, I2=7.4%). All SASC interventions with higher levels of adherence
were significantly more effective (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.84, P<.001, I2=24.5%).
Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis did not support the effectiveness of delivering smartphone-based
interventions alone to achieve higher smoking abstinence rates. However, the efficacy of smartphone-based interventions increased
when combined with pharmacotherapy-based smoking cessation approaches.

Introduction
Smoking is a leading cause of premature death globally. Among
tobacco-related deaths, cigarette smoking accounts for half of
the people who regularly smoke [1-3]. Quitting smoking reduces
the risk of all-cause mortality by 11%-34% [4]. However, an
estimated 1.3 billion individuals worldwide continue to use
tobacco products [5]. Many interventions for promoting smoking
cessation have been implemented worldwide [6-11]. Behavioral
change therapies and pharmacotherapeutics are the most
recommended approaches to assist smoking cessation, both
individually and in combination, and are effective in increasing
smoking cessation in adults [12].
Health information technology–based interventions (such as a
computer, tablet, or smartphone) [13] are associated with
increased smoking cessation in the general population [9,13].
The number of smartphone users is increasing [14], and
smartphone app–based interventions have been developed and
are widely used. The advantages of using a smartphone
app–based intervention include the ease of use, as they can be
used anywhere at any time, the ability to provide visual
information via video, and the ability to deliver interventions
on a large scale. Moreover, they also have the ability to tailor
messages in terms using specifically provided information (such
as age, mood, time, and nicotine independence scores) by using
algorithms. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of
smartphone-based interventions for smoking cessation is
currently controversial. To evaluate the cumulative effects of
smartphone app–based smoking cessation (SASC) interventions
on smoking cessation, researchers conducted a Cochrane
systematic review in 2019. However, the level of evidence was
insufficient because the review only included 5 randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) with small sample sizes, which might
have affected the pooled effect of the meta-analysis [9].
Recently, more RCTs of SASC interventions with larger sample
sizes have been conducted [6,15-18], and have provided
opportunities to explore the effectiveness of SASC interventions
with greater confidence. However, the results of those RCTs
were conflicting. Five studies found that the SASC interventions
did not lead to a higher smoking abstinence rate [19-23]; in
contrast, other studies reported that the SASC interventions
increased smoking abstinence [18,24-26]. Hence, our study
aimed to explore the pooled effects of SASC interventions in
promoting smoking abstinence.

Methods
This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (ie, PRISMA)
guidelines [27]. The protocol of this study was registered in the
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(CRD42021267615).

Search Strategy
We performed a comprehensive literature search to identify
RCTs related to the SASC intervention for smoking cessation.
Databases, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase,
PsycINFO, and Web of Science, were searched for published
papers in English. For Chinese publications, we searched the
China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang
databases, which are the primary databases in China. In addition,
we manually searched through the reference lists of study reports
to identify additional eligible studies and contacted the authors
as needed for more information.
The search terms included a combination of keywords related
to mobile health and smoking cessation. The search strategies
used in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the
Cochrane Library are listed in the Multimedia Appendix 1. The
key terms included telemedicine, mobile health, mHealth,
eHealth, telehealth, digital health, mobile phone, mobile device,
cellphone, smartphone, smartphone app*, cellphone app*,
mobile app*, smartphone-based, cellphone-based, mobile
phone-based, portable electronic app*, portable software app*
or smoking, smoking abstinence, smoking cessation, tobacco
abstinence, tobacco use cessation, tobacco quitting, quit* smok*,
give up smok*, and stop* smok*. In addition, search filters were
used to extract only RCTs. The searches were conducted
independently by 2 investigators and they used EndNote (version
X9; Clarivate Analytics) to import and manage selected articles.

Study Selection Criteria
Overview
Studies were selected if they evaluated the effect of SASC
interventions, were guided by health behavior change theory,
and used an RCT design, including publications, dissertations,
and
conference
papers
based
on
the
Population–Intervention–Comparison–Outcome (ie, PICO)
method. Although we did not specify the exclusion of pilot
studies in the research proposal, according to the National
Institutes of Health, the goal of pilot work is not to test
hypotheses about the effects of an intervention, but rather to
assess the feasibility and acceptability of an approach to be used
in a larger-scale study [28]. Thus, we calculated the sample size
based on the smoking abstinence rate [24]. As a result, each
group of 113 provides 80% power to detect a 15% reduction in
smoking abstinence rate with 2-sided testing and set at .05 and
the following equivalence tests for the difference of 2
proportions in a cluster-randomized design. For this review,
pilot studies (each group with fewer than 113 participants) were
excluded.

PICO Elements
Population
Eligible participants included (1) anyone who smokes ≥5
cigarettes per day and (2) active users of a smartphone.

J Med Internet Res 2023 | vol. 25 | e43242 | p. 2
(page number not for citation purposes)

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
Exclusion criteria included studies with participants younger
than 18 years.
Intervention
Smartphone app–assisted interventions to support smoking
cessation based on health behavior change theory. According
to Gitlin [29], without a theory, behavioral interventions will
have limited success. The theory addresses 3 broad essential
questions: why the intervention should work (the development
phase), how the intervention works (the evaluation phase), and
how the intervention works in real settings (the implementation
phase). Most of the studies reported that the intervention was
designed based on the behavioral change theory. For the reports
that did not cite a guiding theory, the corresponding authors
were contacted to confirm the use of the health behavior change
theory prior to selecting the study for inclusion in the review.
Comparison
The comparison group could be any other type of supportive
smoking cessation, including standard care, SMS text messaging
intervention, web-based intervention, or smoking cessation
counseling.
Outcomes
The outcome was the smoking abstinence rate, reported as either
a 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate or a continuous
abstinence rate, assessed at least 3 months after baseline using
objective or self-report measures. According to the Nicotine
and Tobacco Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification [30],
biochemical validation is not always necessary in smoking
cessation studies since levels of misrepresentation are generally
low (0%-8.8%), thus reducing the likelihood of bias in reporting.
All studies measuring smoking abstinence, including solely
self-reported outcomes, were included.

Data Extraction
Titles and abstracts were retrieved using the search strategy by
an author (YQG), and the duplicates were removed. Based on
the selection criteria, 2 reviewers (YQG and YW) independently
screened the titles and abstracts. The authors (YQG and YLC)
reviewed the full texts, and any disagreements were resolved
through discussion until consensus was reached or by consulting
the third author (YW). The full texts of the selected papers were
reviewed, and the reasons for exclusion were documented.
Two reviewers (YQG and YLC) then independently extracted
the data from each eligible study. The extracted information
included: (1) study characteristics, including authors’ names,
year of publication, country setting, study design, sample
characteristics, name of the smartphone app–assisted
interventions to support smoking cessation, comparator, details
of the intervention, type of outcome measurements, retention
rate, funding, and conflict of interest, follow-up period, whether
or not the RCT protocol was published or registered; and (2)
the outcomes of interest included biochemically verified
smoking abstinence rate or self-reported smoking abstinence
rates from different smoking cessation interventions after 3, 6,
and 12 months.

Risk-of-Bias Assessment
Two reviewers (YQG and YLC) independently assessed the
quality of studies according to the Cochrane Collaboration risk
of the bias assessment tool, RoB 2 [31,32], which includes 5
domains corresponding to specific types of bias: (1) bias arising
from the randomization process, (2) bias due to deviations from
intended interventions, (3) bias due to missing outcome data,
(4) bias in the measurement of the outcome, and (5) bias in the
selection of the reported result. A judgment of “low risk,” “high
risk,” or “some concern” of bias was assigned to each domain.
Disagreements between the 2 reviewers were resolved by
consulting with the third reviewer (YW). A final decision was
made after the 3 reviewers reached a consensus.

Data Synthesis and Analysis
We analyzed the pooled effects of continuous or
point-prevalence tobacco abstinence rates as the primary
outcomes. Subgroup analyses were performed based on different
follow-up points, interventions (solely SASC interventions or
SASC combined with pharmacotherapies), levels of adherence,
and outcome measure methods.
The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan (version 5.4;
Cochrane Training), a desktop version of Review Manager
software. The funnel plot, a simple scatter plot of the
intervention effect estimates from individual studies against
some measure of each study’s size or precision, and the Begg
and Egger tests were conducted with Stata (version 17 SE;
StataCorp) software to determine the presence of publication
bias. The number of people randomized to the intervention and
control groups was extracted to calculate the odds ratio (OR).
The pooled effect sizes are presented in forest plots.
Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the chi-square
test, and I2 values were used to determine heterogeneity across
studies, attributing to the proportion of total variation, in which
an I2>50% indicated substantial heterogeneity of effects, and
random-effects models were applied. If the I2 was <50%,
fixed-effects models were selected [33]. A leave-one-out
sensitivity analysis was done by removing each trial from the
analysis to explore whether an outlier trial had an undue
influence on the meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were
performed based on different follow-up time points.
Additionally, we separated the RCTs by whether the SASC
interventions were used alone or with adjuvants of clinical
smoking cessation therapy. All statistical tests were 2-tailed,
and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Results of the Literature Search
Our initial search yielded 2659 publications based on the defined
search terms (Figure 1). After removing 1073 duplicates and
irrelevant publications, a total of 1506 abstracts were screened,
of which 1468 articles were excluded. The full-text reports for
38 potential studies were retrieved, of which 29 studies were
excluded. According to the selection criteria, a final sample of

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
9 studies was included in this review. A flowchart of the study
selection process is presented in Figure 1.
Nine RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of
12,967 participants. Sample sizes ranged from 240 to 5293
participants. The finally included trials were all published
between 2018 and 2022, even though there was no year limit
used as a search strategy. Among the included studies, 4 were
conducted in European countries (the United Kingdom, Spain,
France, or Switzerland) [21,22,24,26], 3 in the United States
[20,23,25], 1 in Canada [19], and 1 in Japan [18]. Five studies
reported biochemically verified measurements of smoking
abstinence, and 4 studies relied on self-reported smoking

Guo et al
abstinence. The mean age of the included participants ranged
from 36 to 54 years old. The reported smoking abstinence rate
among SASC groups varied from 7.8% to 63.9%. The
comparators consisted of self-help booklets, web-based
behavioral therapy, brief information or calculators (such as
days without cigarettes or money saved), or scheduling
interactions between patients and smoking cessation consultants.
The details of compensation paid to the participants were
reported in 5 studies [18,19,23,25,26], but not in the other 4
studies [20-22,24]. The characteristics of participants,
intervention details, and outcome measures are presented in
Tables 1 and 2.

Risk of Bias
Bias was assessed based on the Cochrane risk of the bias
assessment tool, RoB 2 [31,32]. Three studies were
double-blinded [19,22,25], 4 studies used the single-blinded
approach of either the participants [18,24] or study staff [23,26],
and 2 studies did not report the blinding method [20,21]. In fact,
given the nature of the SASC interventions, researchers could
not prevent the participants from knowing their group
assignment.

Several sources of bias were found. The rate of loss to follow-up
was high, and the representativeness of the research results was
biased. Four studies reported that the retention rate was less
than 50%, reflecting moderate risk. More details are shown in
Figure 2. Even though 4 included studies used self-report to
measure smoking abstinence, we did not consider it a high
source of bias in the measurement of the outcome since
biochemical validation is not always necessary in smoking
cessation studies because levels of misrepresentation are
generally low (0%-8.8%) [30].

As shown in Figure 3, the funnel plot was conducted to identify
whether publication bias existed. The funnel plot was generally

symmetrical (Egger test, P=.10; Begg test, P=.12), which
implied no publication bias existed in the included studies.

Results of the Meta-analysis
The smoking abstinence rate among the 9 enrolled studies is
displayed in Figure 4. There was no significant difference in
the smoking abstinence rate between the experimental and

control groups (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.56, P=.06, I2=73.6%).
A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed to examine
the results. As displayed in Table 3, the sensitivity analysis
shows that our results did not change in the heterogeneity

Subgroup Analysis of Smartphone App–Based
Intervention at Different Follow-Up Time Points
Referring to Figure 5, subgroup analysis was performed to
further explore the differences in effectiveness by the duration
of follow-up. The 4 studies that reported 3-month results (3
studies, N=3442) found no significant differences between the
SASC group and the control group (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.96-2.24,
P=.08, I2=81.9%). Moreover, at the 6-month follow-up (8
studies, N=12,727), no statistically significant differences were

observed between groups (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.95-1.50, P=.12,
I2=74.2%). Studies that reported the smoking abstinence rate
at 12 months (3 studies, N=1342) found statistically significant
differences between groups (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.38-2.33,
P<.001, I2=7%) [18,24,26]. However, among all 3 studies, both
the intervention and control groups received pharmacotherapy.
On top of that, the intervention groups also received smartphone
app–based interventions, while the comparator group only
received pharmacotherapy. In this way, the effect of smartphone
app–based intervention was observed.

Subgroup Analysis of Solely SASC Interventions or
SASC Combined With Pharmacotherapies
Referring back to the elements of the interventions (Multimedia
Appendix 2), it shows 6 studies delivered the health behavior
change theories driving smoking cessation intervention by
smartphone apps alone; however, 3 studies used the apps to
augment pharmacological cessation therapies. As shown in
Figure 6, 6 studies with smartphone app–based interventions
alone reported no significant differences in effectiveness
between the 2 groups (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85-1.26, P=.74,

I2=57.1%). However, intervention groups combining
smartphone-based app use and pharmacologic therapies for
smoking cessation (3 studies, N=1342) reduced the chance of
quitting smoking. Researchers conducted the interventions via
smartphone apps, coupled with pharmacotherapies and
consultations for the participants. On the other hand,
comparators were pharmacotherapies and consultations for the
participants. The smartphone app combined with
pharmacotherapies and consultation groups increased the
smoking abstinence rate compared with the comparators (OR
1.79, 95% CI 1.38-2.33, P<.001, I2=7%).

(OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.18, P=.99, I2=59%). However, 5

pharmacotherapy intervention studies used the bio-verified
method to measure smoking abstinence. To minimize the
intervention factors, we explored the pooled effect of
bio-verified outcomes studies by removing those 3 studies.

Discussion
Principal Findings
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 9
relatively high-quality RCTs through a comprehensive database
search to determine the impact of SASC interventions. A total
of 12,967 adult participants were included in this study.
Although our findings failed to prove that SASC interventions
alone were effective for smoking abstinence, improved smoking
abstinence was achieved when SASC interventions were used
to augment smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. In addition,
improved smoking abstinence was shown for studies with
participants recruited from the clinic rather than through the
web. The study also found that the method for measuring the
outcome of smoking cessation (self-report or verified biological
measures) did not necessarily impact outcome assessment, which
is consistent with previous reports [30]. Compared to previous
meta-analyses of SASC interventions, this study identified more
reports of RCTs with larger sample sizes, allowing us to draw
more accurate and valid inferences. In addition, bias was
assessed in 5 distinct domains via RoB 2. Within each domain,
we answered the signaling questions. These answers lead to
judgments of “low risk of bias,” “some concerns,” or “high risk
of bias.” Major biases in the included studies were the lack of
https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e43242

blinding; given the nature of the intervention and the control,
some researchers could not blind participants to treatments.
Thus, the results may reflect participant expectation bias.
Furthermore, not all research programs could capture consistent
participant-level data on intervention adherence, which may
increase the nonrespondent bias.
Based on our meta-analysis, there are several possible reasons
why SASC interventions alone showed lower smoking
abstinence rates. First, adherence to smartphone app–based
interventions may be the main reason for the failure of smoking
cessation. As shown in our results, lower abstinence rates
resulted from poor adherence to the intervention. On the
contrary, Masaki and Webb’s studies [18,26] reported that
SASC-assisted pharmacotherapy groups had higher smoking
abstinence rates, possibly because SASC intervention could
increase the participants’ understanding of behavioral
intervention methods and provide smoking cessation information
at any time. In addition, as shown in our results, improved
smoking abstinence was achieved if the study participants were
recruited from clinics rather than through the web. Smokers
who took smoking cessation medications had face-to-face
communication and clinical follow-up with clinic smoking
cessation consultants, which in turn may have increased
smokers’ motivation and frequency of using smoking cessation
apps.

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
Poor adherence may result from the ubiquitous low engagement
of the smartphone app–based intervention, which is not
uncommon and consistent with previous health behavior change
studies [34-36]. Smartphone-based interventions may have little
effect if individuals do not adhere to the intervention protocol
[29]. We did not do the meta-analysis based on engagement
because the measures of engagement with the intervention were
inconsistent and inadequate [37,38], as they did not monitor the
number of log-ins or time spent using each module to verify
the engagement. Although there is no consensus on the
benchmarks for reporting eHealth engagement, engagement
could be increased through various mechanisms that depend
heavily on the characteristics of current technology, users’
characteristics (such as literacy and habits), and their
environmental factors. Therefore, to raise adherence to SASC
interventions, it is highly suggested to consider improving the
app to support smokers’ engagement and setting benchmarks
for reporting smartphone-based interventions. In addition, the
financial compensation paid may also increase the motivation
to complete the intervention.
Secondly, ineffective intervention may result from not fully
exploiting features. The features of smartphone apps that have
the potential to support behavior change and customization,
such as real-time feedback, individualized messaging, or
interaction, may have increased the effectiveness and
individualization of app-based interventions. Etter’s study [22]
provided automated, individually tailored counseling messages
based on the user’s profile, regularly sent for 6 months,
immediate feedback during episodes of craving and tobacco
withdrawal symptoms, and a module on nicotine therapy that
includes personalized feedback and follow-up. Webb’s study
[26] provided personalized CBT-based support via the in-app
chat and phone, with a 30-min phone call at baseline, discussing
their individualized quit plan and methods of using NRT. Affret
et al’s [21] study provided personalized messages relating to
the answers to the different questionnaires. The details of the
customized features were various. There was a lack of
representativeness and a precise definition of the individualized
in the real sense. We did not check the effectiveness based on
the extent of the individualization feature. In fact, with the
current level of artificial intelligence technology development,
computer engineers have been able to provide instantaneous
ecological momentary assessment methods, predict smoking
risks based on user data, and push timely information based on
algorithms. However, researchers may face numerous barriers
when offering SASC intervention; for instance, research
participants may worry about their privacy or consider
cumbersome data entry a burden. To date, only a few SASC
intervention studies have achieved individualization and timely
information response.
Although smartphone app–based intervention alone did not
achieve superior efficacy, higher effect sizes were found in
studies that combined smartphone app–based intervention with
pharmacotherapy. There might be 2 reasons for this, which
include the fact that SASC intervention is not limited by time
or region, as app users can receive the intervention according
to their schedule. Second, the smokers who received
pharmacotherapy are regularly followed up by physicians, which
https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e43242

XSL• FO
RenderX

Guo et al
may increase the stickiness of app use. In addition, we found
that the SASC is more effective at 12 months than shorter
follow-ups. This could be because all 12-month follow-up
studies are the same studies that intervene with the participants
with the SASC combined with pharmacotherapy. To assist
smokers in quitting smoking in the future, it is recommended
to use SASC intervention in smokers who receive smoking
cessation drug treatment. Future studies can reflect on how to
balance the frequency of the combination of outpatient follow-up
and SASC to maximize the smoking cessation rate with the
minimized cost of human medical resources.

Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of our meta-analysis are that all of the included
studies had large sample sizes. Although smoking cessation
research based on smartphone apps is still emerging, our
research team included many high-quality RCTs, which allowed
us to draw more accurate and valid inferences. Moreover, all
the included studies conducted behavioral theory-driven
interventions, which could enhance the delivery of the
intervention and boost its effects on participants. However, our
study also has some limitations. First, heterogeneity among the
included studies still exists even after we applied the subgroup
and sensitivity analyses. Second, subgroup analysis based on
different follow-up times had been conducted, but the number
of included studies was even lower. Third, although all smoking
cessation interventions were applied by smartphone apps, the
specific interventions may vary widely between the studies.
Fourth, low adherence to the SASC intervention brought
increased threats to the research’s reliability and validity. Lastly,
the abstinence outcome criteria used in the included studies
varied, such as continuous smoking abstinence and 7-day point
prevalence smoking abstinence indicators, which may also
increase the heterogeneity of the pool studies. Future work on
improving adherence to SASC intervention is warranted to
evaluate the future effect of SASC intervention. It is
recommended to use SASC intervention in the future for
smokers who receive smoking cessation drug treatment to assist
smokers to quit smoking and to continue to refine the frequency
of the combination of outpatient follow-up and SASC to
maximize the smoking cessation rate and optimize the cost of
human medical resources. Finally, although the promise of the
engagement report of the SASC intervention has not yet been
fully realized, future research may provide insight into how to
target the engagement of smartphone app–based interventions,
which may affect intervention adherence and smoking cessation
abstinence.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our study is confined to determining the
effectiveness of smartphone-based apps in smoking cessation
intervention within the boundaries of existing evidence. The
current meta-analysis did not reveal superior effects for
stand-alone smartphone-based apps. However, smartphone
app–based interventions may be the most effective tool affiliated
with pharmacotherapeutics. Furthermore, smartphone app–based
interventions with good adherence showed improved smoking
abstinence. More rigorously designed RCTs with robust
engagement reporting should be encouraged to test the

systematic review of qualitative studies

Abstract
Background: Smoking cessation in pregnancy has unique challenges. Health providers (HP) may need support to
successfully implement smoking cessation care (SCC) for pregnant women (PW). We aimed to synthesize qualitative
data about views of HPs and PW on SCC during pregnancy using COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation,
Behaviour) framework.
Methods: A systematic search of online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL) using PRISMA
guidelines. PW’s and HPs’ quotes, as well as the authors’ analysis, were extracted and double-coded (30%) using the
COM-B framework.
Results: Thirty-two studies included research from 5 continents: 13 on HPs’ perspectives, 15 on PW’s perspectives,
four papers included both. HPs’ capability and motivation were affected by role confusion and a lack of training,
time, and resources to provide interventions. HPs acknowledged that advice should be delivered while taking
women’s psychological state (capability) and stressors into consideration. Pregnant women’s physical capabilities to
quit (e.g., increased metabolism of nicotine and dependence) was seldom addressed due to uncertainty about
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use in pregnancy. Improving women’s motivation to quit depended on
explaining the risks of smoking versus the safety of quit methods. Women considered advice from HPs during
antenatal visits as effective, if accompanied by resources, peer support, feedback, and encouragement.
Conclusions: HPs found it challenging to provide effective SCC due to lack of training, time, and role confusion.
The inability to address psychological stress in women and inadequate use of pharmacotherapy were additional
barriers. These findings could aid in designing training programs that address HPs’ and PW’s attitudes and
supportive campaigns for pregnant smokers.

Background
Smoking tobacco during pregnancy is an established risk
factor for a range of health problems for mothers and
the baby, including long term complications in childhood. Exposure to tobacco smoke in-utero increases the
risk of still birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age babies [1]. Women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to experience obstetric
complications such as spontaneous abortions, placental
abruption, placenta previa, premature labour, and ectopic pregnancies compared to women who don’t smoke
during pregnancy [1]. Globally, 1.7% of pregnant women
(PW) smoke during pregnancy [2]. Five countries
namely Ireland, Uruguay, Bulgaria, Spain and Denmark
have the highest rates of smoking in pregnancy ranging
from 25 to 38%. Research suggests that a significant proportion of women stop smoking when they become
pregnant, mainly to safeguard their baby from the harms
of smoking [3]. However, worldwide, 50% of women
who smoke continue to do so during pregnancy [2]. Experiencing social or economic disadvantage, particularly
poverty, living in a normalized smoking environment,
low access to healthcare and a highly stressful life are
significant predictors of smoking during pregnancy [4].
For example, Indigenous women from developed countries, who may be exposed to all of the aforesaid, have
double the smoking prevalence compared to their pregnant, non-Indigenous counterparts [5]. Other risk factors for smoking during pregnancy include being an
older mother, teenage mother, multiparty, high nicotine
dependence, experiencing intimate partner violence or
mental health issues such as depression [4].
The health provider’s role in smoking cessation

High quality evidence suggests behavioral interventions
such as counseling, feedback, and incentives increase
smoking cessation rates in pregnancy [6]. Pragmatic research also suggests that nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT) increases smoking cessation rates among PW, although more research to account for the higher nicotine
metabolism during pregnancy and research on higher
doses of NRT are needed [7]. Smoking cessation guidelines from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the
United Kingdom recommend NRT use by PW to
achieve smoking cessation if behavioral methods are not
successful [7]. The onus of translating the existing smoking cessation research lies on health providers (HPs)
who remain the mainstay for providing smoking cessation care to PW. HPs that care for PW come from several disciplines, including medical practitioners,
midwives, and Community Health Workers. Clinical
smoking cessation guidelines usually recommend a
structured approach such as the 5As (Ask, Assess, Advise, Assist and Arrange) or the ABC (Ask, Brief advice

Page 2 of 14

and Cessation support) [8] to HPs to ensure the completeness of the smoking cessation intervention. Despite
these guidelines, smoking cessation interventions may be
underutilized by HPs [9–11]. Additionally, there is little
practical guidance for HPs such as how to weigh up the
risks versus benefits of using NRT in pregnancy, and
how to titrate the dosage of NRT to account for PW’s
faster metabolism [7]. There is limited research about
HPs’ knowledge and attitudes about providing smoking
cessation care to smoking PW during their consultations
[12, 13]. Given that smoking cessation in pregnancy has
unique challenges, HPs may need additional training and
skills for the successful implementation of smoking cessation interventions for PW.
A large number of theories and models have been
proposed to explain the complex science of behavior
change. The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) is a
parsimonious model that takes into account multiple
behavior change theories (See Fig. 1). At its center
(green hub) is the COM-B model [14]. COM-B is an
acronym for capability (C)- physical and psychological, Opportunity (O)- physical and social and Motivation (M)- automatic and reflective, all of which
drive behavior change (B) [14]. Most behavior change
interventions incorporate one or more of these behavior change principles. However, a successful intervention ideally should take all three tiers of the wheel
into consideration [15]. Consequently, the COM-B
and BCW can be used to analyze a behavior change
intervention to identify if an intervention has used a
systematic approach to achieve its desired outcomes,
what mechanism of actions were operationalized and
if the intervention failed, the possible reasons for its
failure [15]. Intervention functions and policies are
captured in the middle (red) and outer (grey) rings
respectively.
This systematic review aims to synthesize published
qualitative research about smoking cessation care provided by HPs to PW who smoke. The primary objective was to explore both HPs’ and PW’s perspectives
on smoking cessation care using a COM-B framework
with reference also to the BCW. A secondary aim
was to identify intervention functions how the capability, opportunity, and motivation of HPs could be
improved to provide optimum smoking cessation care
during pregnancy. Intervention functions are broad
categories of means by which an intervention can
change behaviour. Intervention functions as described
by Michie S [15] include education, persuasion, incentivization, coercion, training, restriction, environmental restructuring, modelling and enablement. We have
highlighted intervention functions (IF) where they
were apparent from the extracted data, but not for
every finding.

Methods
Data sources and study selection

Underpinned by PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search
was carried out in research databases including MEDL
INE; EMBASE; PsycINFO and CINAHL until March
2020 (see Fig. 2). Keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms related to ‘Health providers,’ Search
terms: “Attitudes and practices; “smoking” and; “pregnancy” were used (Supplemental file 1: Full search strategy in Medline).
Inclusion criteria

Peer-reviewed, qualitative, or mixed methods studies,
written in English, were included. The topics explored
were: the views of any HPs about the provision of established forms of smoking cessation care to PW (for example the 5As or smoking cessation guidelines) in any

setting and papers exploring women’s views on the
smoking cessation care received from their HPs. There
was no restriction on publication date.
Exclusions

Studies exclusively reporting quantitative data, evaluating new programs or interventions (papers reporting
qualitative data on established practices were not considered new), in non-peer reviewed journals, or only minimally covered the topic.
This review was a part of a larger review registered
with PROSPERO in 2015: CRD42015029989. The quantitative data were analyzed and published separately [11].
Data extraction

The review team included a General Practitioner (GG),
Public Health Physician (YBZ), Public Health Dentist

Fig. 2 Summary of the article selection process as recommended by the PRISMA statement

(RK), Health Promotion Expert (LS), Epidemiologist (JJ),
Psychologist (GRG), Gender and Health Expert (PE) and
Behavioural Scientist (LT). Authors have an extensive
background in tobacco cessation, epidemiology, and
qualitative research. Electronic databases were searched
by LS, RK, YBZ and LT, who independently screened
the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles. Full-text
articles were independently by two authors (YBZ, LT, JJ,
GRG, LS, PE). Date range was from August 2015 to
March 2020. A third author adjudicated discrepancies by
mutual discussion (GG). Reference lists of the included
articles were searched for additional papers and original
articles thus retrieved included if they fulfilled the eligibility criteria. We only analyzed the study with available
results as a part of the published manuscript and did not
contact the authors for further detail. Microsoft Excel
was used to record the study characteristics namely title,
authors, year of publication, setting, aims, study design,
methodological orientation, quotes (first-order constructs), themes and subthemes (second-order constructs), explanatory models (third-order constructs),
sample size and focus of the interviews. Data were extracted by one author (LS) from the full texts of the

articles, quality checked by a second author (YBZ and
GRG) for twelve of the articles (45%).

Analysis
Quality assessment

Since there are very few established quality assessment
tools for qualitative studies and due to the research
team’s prior experience, the Hawker Quality Assessment
Tool [16, 17] was used to for the quality assessment of
the studies. This tool assesses studies using nine questions; potential ratings and corresponding numerical
scores were good (4), fair (3), poor (2), and very poor
(1). Scores for each study were totaled to give a score indicative of the overall quality of the study, ranging from
a minimum of 9 points to a maximum of 36 points.
Studies were classified as high quality (30–36 points);
medium quality (24–29 points) or low quality (9–24
points) [17]. Initially 5% of randomly selected papers
were assessed by LS, YBZ and GB. Where the reviewers
assigned different domain scores to a study, the differences were discussed among co-authors with GG adjudicating to resolve the difference to arrive at a final

Kumar et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth

(2021) 21:550

domain score. The rest of the papers were then scored
by LS informed by the discussion and adjudication.
COM-B analysis

For this review, the BCW [14, 18] and the COM-B model
[14, 18] were used to analyze the smoking cessation care
delivered by HPs or received by PW who smoked. We
coded for all aspects of care delivery from the viewpoint of
HPs and women, including barriers and facilitators as well
as the actual care delivered. First-order constructs (quotes)
from HPs and PW and second-order constructs (interpretations by authors or themes) were extracted line by line
from the included papers and coded using the COM-B
framework and its sub-components. Quotes were multicoded if they reflected more than one component or subcomponent of the COM-B framework. LS completed coding; 30% of the papers were double coded to ensure
consistency (JJ and RK). GG reviewed the coding to ensure
consistency. BCW Policy categories (grey zone BCW- Fig.
1) and Intervention functions (red zone BCW- Fig. 1)
were selected by GG and RK to describe which intervention functions and policy measures (aimed at HPs and/or
PW) were indicated by the data, according to the BCW.
The data was synthesized by creating a narrative within
each theme within the COM-B framework. Coders (JJ, RK
and LS) continuously reflected on their own inherent
biases. In particular, the researchers were aware during
the data collection and analysis process of their backgrounds in smoking cessation and intervention delivery
might bias the interpretation of findings. Assumptions
while analyzing the data were discussed with GG for
arbitration.

Results
This review included 32 qualitative and mixed methods
studies [19–51]: 13 focused exclusively on the HPs’ perspectives [19–30, 51], 15 exclusively on PW’s perspectives [31, 33–46], while four papers included both [47–
50]. Twenty studies were conducted in Europe [19, 21,
22, 25–27, 30, 31, 34, 36, 38, 39, 41–45, 47, 49, 51], eight
in the Oceania region [20, 24, 29, 33, 37, 40, 46, 50], two
in the USA [23, 35] and one each in South America [48]
and Africa [28]. HPs included doctors, nurses, midwives,
Aboriginal Health Workers, pharmacists and other allied
HPs. Please see Supplementary file 2 for the characteristics of included studies.
Quality assessments

Seventeen studies were rated as high quality [19, 21, 24–
26, 29, 33–36, 38, 41, 44, 45, 47, 50, 51], 12 as medium
quality [20, 23, 27, 28, 31, 37, 40, 42, 43, 46, 48, 49]
while 3 studies [22, 30, 39] were of low quality. Please
see Table 1 for the quality assessment of included
studies.

Qualitative COM-B analysis

Sub-headings of Capability, Opportunity and Motivation,
and their subcomponents were used to either group results into smoking cessation care provided by HPs to
PW or received by PW. Intervention functions, the range
of functions within an intervention that support behaviour change and Policy categories from the BCW [14]
(i.e., the middle (red) and outer (grey) rings) denoted as
“IF” and “P” in brackets. Please see Table 2 for representative quotes related to each COM-B theme.
Physical capability

HPs’ physical capabilities to provide smoking cessation
advice and interventions in pregnant smokers are not
relevant, as most HPs are physically capable of achieving
this end. However, this category touches on PW’s physical capability to quit smoking, as many may experience
physical dependence. PW stated that HP did not sufficiently assist them in dealing with their physical dependence [33, 45]. Because this concerns a HP’s
psychological capability to aid PW in that way, we have
placed it in that section.
Psychological capability

This theme explored HPs’ psychological capabilities to
provide effective quit smoking advice to their clients as
well as how HPs addressed the psychological capabilities
of their clients for quitting smoking.
HPs’ knowledge about providing smoking cessation interventions was a significant factor affecting the delivery
of smoking cessation advice to their clients. HPs believed
that greater knowledge about providing smoking cessation interventions might help them provide better smoking cessation care to PW who smoke (IF – education)
[23, 49]. Lack of knowledge about providing smoking
cessation interventions sometimes led to low selfefficacy in HPs to change the behavior of their pregnant
clients who smoke [19–24, 27, 48]. This also supports
the issue of HPs lack of knowledge about NRT added to
the issue of HPs not being able to provide effective quite
smoking advice.
Developing sensitivity towards PW’s psychological
state was of paramount importance to the success of the
smoking cessation intervention by the HPs and a known
factor affecting the psychological capability of PW to
quit smoking [41]. HPs acknowledged that PW, trying to
quit smoking, might not be able to do so successfully
due to socio-economic stress and resultant psychological
challenges [23, 37, 50].
In such cases, some HPs utilized their psychological
skills to help evoke feelings of control and empowerment in PW [28]. This may be achieved by providing

[19]. However, some HPs lacked training (IF -education
and training) to address smoking in PW, especially with
women who were stressed, had unsuccessful quit attempts or did not want to quit [23, 49, 25]. Stress was
detrimental to PW, and in rare instances, HPs encouraged PW to continue smoking to avoid the stress attributed to quitting attempts [36, 38, 42, 51, 48].
Communicating the best health advice (IF - education)
without making the PW feel guilty, while also trying to
maintain a congenial relationship (IF -enablement) with
their client, was often challenging for the HPs [19, 22,
24, 29, 30, 35, 42, 48, 52, 53]. Some HPs overcame this
dilemma by recommending cutting down to reduce
smoking-related harms rather than quitting, perhaps
potentially preserving the relationship with their client
(IF – enablement) [23, 24, 27, 29, 33, 40, 43, 46, 48, 53].
Although NRT is known to improve the physical capability of smokers to quit by reducing withdrawal symptoms, NRT was considered controversial by HPs who
were reluctant to prescribe it or did not offer it frequently (IF - education) [22, 24, 27, 29, 33, 37]. Inadequate institutional policies and guidelines contributed
to suboptimal use of NRT (e.g., not prescribing NRT to
PW unless they have had a failed unassisted quit attempt) (P– guidelines) [22, 24, 27, 48]. Lack of knowledge among HPs affected the motivation of HPs to
prescribe NRT, potentially contributing to continued
smoking among PW [22, 29].
Skepticism about NRT was quite prevalent among PW
[22, 31–34]. Widespread uncertainty about NRT among
PW may indicate a need for a more detailed and comprehensive conversation during the consultation about
NRT use to address doubts and concerns about the potential harms of NRT versus the benefits, although the
HPs were not always successful in this endeavor (IF - enablement) [31–34].

HPs who had never smoked found it difficult to
empathize with their pregnant clients who smoked [49].
HPs who themselves smoked hardly provided any smoking cessation counseling [52]. PW corroborated that HPs
who smoked did not encourage them to quit or were
not insistent enough [35, 52, 53]. For example, PW
states this in McLeod, et al. [53]: “My specialist he
smokes so (he) does not advocate giving up smoking.”.
In contrast, HPs who were ex-smokers sometimes
acted as role models for the PW to quit smoking (IF –
modeling): “I tell them that I did it so they can jolly well
do it too… because I’ve smoked” McLeod, et al. [53]. HPs
who themselves were ex-smokers were perceived as less
judgmental (IF - enablement) and more understanding
of PW’s smoking.
HPs reported PW becoming defensive if smoking cessation consultations evoked stigmatizing feelings of ignorance, guilt, and irresponsibility [24, 49, 50]. Although
smoking cessation advice from HPs was expected and
acceptable [43, 53, 54]. some PW resisted counselling
when HPs initiated a dialogue about smoking and may
counter HP advice with anecdotes and arguments that
contested the smoking cessation narrative of HPs [27,
28, 35, 51, 45, 48, 50].
However, this does not necessarily prevent HP from
deliberately using persuasion (IF - persuasion). Some
PW supported HPs using ‘shock tactics’ to get the message of smoking cessation through to them [35, 42].
Some HPs considered providing smoking cessation advice to PW who were stressed to be risky in case their
advice could have the opposite effect [38]. Conversely,
some PW described their experiences of feeling pressured, stigmatized, and sometimes intimidated by the
HPs for being a PW who smokes [35, 37]. Monetary
compensation for quitting was generally not considered
acceptable by both HPs and PW, as quitting smoking

HP-Gynaecologist-De Wilde, 2015- 1st order
I advised this patient to see her GP for patches or gum, but her

I could use more information. There’s new stuff every day that
relates to smoking, so I know there’s new and up-to-date stuff that
we probably don’t know about.
HP- Aquilino, 2003- 1st order

I can remember the conversation we had about it and [the
smoking cessation advisor] was letting me know where I can put
[the patches] and what not, but to myself I just thought no, that’s

know, it’s weird, I just think it’s too close to the baby to be having
all that nicotine going in.
Woman- Bowker, 2015- 1st order
The doctor so scared me at the ante-natal clinic when she said that
there were new studies showing that the baby flinches every time
you puff the cigarette, that it is really painful (for the fetus). I didn’t
think it was that serious. So every time I smoke and I feel the baby
move, I think of this. That makes me stop smoking at once.

HP- Health visitor, Bull, 2007- 1st order

I think it’d be easier to quit smoking if you had something like an

was considered to be linked to PW’s intrinsic value and
self-worth rather than an extrinsic reward [36].
HP training in smoking cessation emerged as a distinct
facilitator that increased the psychological capability of
HPs to support smoking cessation in PW or refer them
to other HPs who can offer smoking cessation advice
[49]. Developing specific skills, such as motivational
interviewing or how to discuss cessation while the PW
are trying to quit, was especially desired [24, 29]. Some
HPs implied that they are only able to provide very rudimentary counseling regarding smoking and its harmful
effects on the fetus.
However, the lack of training opportunities was widespread [22, 29, 48, 52], and some HPs had not had any
training at all [22, 29, 52]. These lacunae were specifically in the domains of asking, assessing, and advising
about smoking cessation in a way that does not offend
or alienate pregnant clients [29]. HPs wanted smoking
cessation training to be ongoing and training content
updated frequently to keep up with the new guidelines
and research (IF – training; P – guidelines) [23, 48].
PW complained that some HPs often asked about
their smoking status but never provided any practical
support to help them quit pointing towards a lack of
skills for providing holistic smoking cessation care [33,
40, 43, 49, 54].

Physical opportunity

This theme described opportunities afforded to HPs by
their physical environment for providing smoking cessation care to PW, and opportunities that PW reported
were provided to them or were lacking from HP for
smoking cessation care.
Some PW complained that they were not adequately
informed about the harmful effects of smoking by their
HPs, nor were encouraged on their attempts to cut
down or quit smoking [46, 48, 49].
Time for HPs to provide smoking cessation support
was limited, as were the resources to educate PW [22,
27, 35, 45, 48, 49, 52]. HPs (and sometimes PW) commonly felt they did not have enough time to provide adequate assistance to help PW quit, or that motivating
PW to quit would be a waste of time (automatic motivation) [22–24, 27, 45, 48, 52].
HPs often integrated quit smoking discussions with
physical examinations to save time. Providing group quit
smoking information sessions (IF -environmental restructuring) was suggested as a way to save time. HPs suggested that the waiting time before the consultations
could be used to show quit smoking videos to PW and
their partners, saving time during the consultation (IF environmental restructuring) and motivating PW to quit
(IF = persuasion) [26, 48]. However, HPs went further to

Page 9 of 14

suggest that pressure (IF - coercion) may be used to force
PW to watch and confirm viewing the content [35].
Counseling strategies, such as detailed and structured
protocols, saved time and were desired by HPs [24, 50].
These resources could also enhance their psychological
capability by increasing knowledge and confidence in delivering smoking cessation interventions. However, some
HPs highlighted that there were no clear guidelines or
pathways (P- guidelines) in their institution on providing
smoking cessation assistance to PW [22, 27, 48].
In some instances, informational resources such as
pamphlets, educational videos, and other self-help material were not readily available to HPs (despite PWs
wanting to use them), making it difficult for them to
provide smoking cessation health education specific to
PW (P - communication/marketing) [23, 28, 48].
HPs and PW discussed different modes of delivering
quit smoking advice. Face to face delivery was considered the most successful [36]. Electronic means of communication such as telephone and email were thought
to have a role by sending reminders or encouragement
in between face to face appointments, thus improving
PW’s reflective motivation and psychological capability
to quit (P– service provision) [36]. HPs believed that
smoking cessation advice should not overly depend on
the traditional medical model of health information
provision but rather be conveyed creatively through a
wide array of resources, which may be more persuasive
and motivating (reflective motivation for PW) [22, 36].
Along with face to face smoking related discussions with
their doctors, midwives and other office staff, PW were
open to seeing brochures, posters and other health promotional material in the doctor’s office, which they
thought provided additional information and motivated
them to discuss smoking with their HP (physical opportunity; IF - environmental restructuring; P- communication) [43, 48, 54].
Social opportunity

This theme explored interpersonal influences, social factors, and opportunities available to HPs for providing
smoking cessation support to PW.
HPs realized that the baby’s birth could be a significant
opportunity for smoking cessation as PW have innate instincts to protect the baby, and this could motivate PW
to stop smoking. Hence it was considered important to
start a dialogue about smoking even if HPs detected a
reluctance to talk about smoking in their clients [22]. A
supportive, trustful, and a respectful relationship with
the PW was considered paramount to a successful quit
smoking intervention by the HPs (IF - enablement) [19,
29, 30, 48, 49, 53].
HPs believed that it was necessary to reduce social
stigma associated with smoking and make smoking

Kumar et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth

(2021) 21:550

cessation advice non-judgmental, empathetic, and sensitive to PW’s needs and their environmental contexts (IF
– enablement) [22, 28, 30, 36, 41].
In some close-knit communities, such as among Aboriginal populations, PW preferred that smoking cessation
advice be delivered by Elders rather than the HPs as the
Elders were more familiar with the PW and their circumstances (P – service provision) [33].
Social and peer support were considered central to
motivating PW to quit and stay quit, and the role of HPs
in facilitating such support [19, 22, 31]. According to
some participants (PW), HPs provided social support by
continual encouragement to quit [36, 44, 46]. PW who
stopped smoking while pregnant, often relapsed when
the baby was born, mostly due to various life stressors
[23, 53]. HPs stressed the importance of social support
and continued health promotion for PW to quit smoking
and stay quit [19, 31, 53].
Opportunities to deliver quit smoking advice in the
form of group sessions emerged as a preferred method
of promoting smoking cessation and improving motivation among PW [33, 35, 36]. Structured addiction support meetings along the lines of ‘Alcoholics Anonymous’
and buddy systems were also considered useful for providing social support during a quit attempt [22, 35, 36].
Some HPs advocated group smoking cessation interventions for PW early in their pregnancy stages to save
time (physical opportunity) or while performing prenatal consultations [36, 39, 20].
PW concurred that an experiential opportunity involving witnessing or hearing about other people’s lived experiences of the effects of smoking during pregnancy
would encourage them to stop smoking [35].

Automatic motivation

This theme explored the factors that affect HP’s innate
emotional reactions, impulses, and inhibitions related to
providing smoking cessation support to PW. Identification of vulnerabilities such as stress and depression in
PW acted as a deterrent to the provision of smoking cessation care by the HPs [23, 36, 38]. HPs instinctively
tried not to offend their clients and make them feel
supported.
HPs additionally considered it important to improve
the motivation and knowledge of PW about potential
smoking-related harms to the baby as an integral objective of smoking cessation care [23]. To this end, some
HPs presented or wanted to present gruesome imagery
(IF - persuasion) to accentuate the automatic motivation
of PW to quit smoking [19, 35]. Identification of PW’s
motivation to quit and reinforcing it was considered
more successful than introducing new motivations by
the HPs [35].

Page 10 of 14

Pregnant women being praised for efforts to quit
smoking, not being judged for smoking, and not made
to feel guilty about smoking by HPs (IF - enablement)
were significant automatic motivators for the PW to
continue trying to quit smoking [26, 36] However, this
was not always achieved and sometimes PW felt that
they were being pushed or nagged to quit smoking [37].
Reassurance from HPs appeared to pacify PW’s fears
about attempting to quit smoking.
Assumptions about the clients not wanting to quit
smoking and skepticism about their chances to succeed
in becoming smoke-free often informed whether or not
the HPs provided smoking cessation care [29, 48, 20].
Smoking cessation consultations were often labeled
“difficult” [49] HPs feared evoking pain, guilt, and shame
in PW by discussing their smoking, and hence, the topic
of smoking cessation [24, 45, 49]. HPs may instinctively
avoid the issue altogether.
Reflective motivation

This theme explored the processes and beliefs of HPs
that promoted provision of smoking cessation care for
their patients. Some health providers were intrinsically
motivated to provide smoking cessation counseling and
considered it their duty to assist PW to quit smoking
[24, 26, 52]. On the other hand, others felt that it was
not their role to provide smoking cessation interventions
to their clients [29].
Role confusion affected HPs motivation to provide adequate smoking cessation. Clinicians reported they were
not responsible for addressing smoking cessation with
PW and it was better suited to come from smoking cessation specialists, GPs or midwives during pre-natal
clinics [29, 55]. However, midwives described situations
where the topic of smoking cessation was avoided, or
they did not perceive it to be their responsibility either
[27].
Several HPs expressed that they only considered providing smoking cessation assistance to PW if, during the
consultation, they inferred that the PW wanted to quit
smoking [22, 52].
HPs believed that success of a smoking cessation intervention depended on the inherent motivation of their
clients to quit: “if they don’t want to give up you’re bashing your head against a brick wall” [29]. HPs who provided information about the harmful effects of smoking
and quitting methods to PW patently empowered them
with the knowledge to motivate an effective quit
attempt.

Discussion
This systematic review explored qualitative research
from 32 studies (spanning more than 20 years) across
the world about the reported experiences of PW and

Kumar et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth

(2021) 21:550

HPs during smoking cessation care. The analysis of the
qualitative themes used the COM-B behavior change
model’s Behaviour Change Wheel [15]. This model has
been previously used to understand different behaviors
such as NRT use [56], barriers and facilitators of health
behaviors [57, 58] and uptake of health services [59]. Almost all studies included in this review were rated as
high to medium quality, thus indicating greater reliability of the results.
This review found that there was a lack of key intervention functions and policies that could support health
professionals provide good smoking cessation care.
Smoking cessation interventions aimed at improving the
physical capabilities of PW who smoke (i.e., to aid PW
in dealing with the physical addiction to nicotine), were
rarely described or addressed. Nicotine metabolism increases significantly during pregnancy [60], making nicotine withdrawal much more pronounced. Thus, HPs
who are unable to improve the physical capability of PW
through offering NRT may not be successful in enabling
smoking cessation among their clients [61, 62]. Some
PW may be wary of using NRT due to fears of nicotine
harming their baby and thus prefer to continue smoking,
or quit without pharmacological support. This lack of
enthusiasm by both parties towards using NRT has been
demonstrated in other reviews [63] and could significantly hamper the physical capability of PW to overcome their nicotine withdrawal symptoms and quit
smoking successfully.
HPs may hold paternalistic beliefs that expecting PW
who smoke to quit was too challenging for them. Literature suggests that HPs who are not confident of their
counseling techniques will often adopt paternalistic approaches as opposed to HPs who take a patient-centered
approach and act as friends and carers to their clients
[64]. Stress among PW and lack of skills among HPs to
manage it may promote HPs to recommend ‘cutting’
down rather than complete abstinence. Ingall et al.
(2010) [65] similarly found that HPs who were smokers
may support PW to cut down rather than quit completely. Despite some clients perceiving a recommendation to cut down as supportive [66], the latest evidence
and smoking cessation guidelines conclude that
complete abstinence is the best practice [67]. Potential
benefits from smoking reduction are highly questionable
[68]. Our previous research suggests that ‘cutting-down’
to assist towards cessation may delay PW from getting
the benefits for their baby that could be achieved by
complete abstinence [33]. A less prescriptive and more
patient-centered approach may be more useful for behavior change [69].
Lack of time, training, and resources along with role
ambivalence among HPs contribute to many missed opportunities to counsel PW about smoking cessation.

Page 11 of 14

Negative attitudes, lack of knowledge resulting in limited
confidence to discuss smoking cessation, and perceptions of the topic as unpleasant and intrusive, are common barriers to the provision of smoking cessation care
to PW who smoke. These factors combine to rob HPs of
a significant social opportunity to address smoking
among their pregnant clients [70]. Pregnant women who
smoke are not consistently offered health information
related to smoking and its adverse effects, smoking cessation advice, nor provided referrals [24, 71, 72]. Lack of
opportunities for training in smoking cessation has been
raised by other authors, similarly to our study [13, 73].
The results of our review align with themes raised by
systematic reviews by Baxter, Everson-Hock, Messina,
Guillaume, Burrows and Goyder [74] (23 papers) and
Bauld, et al. [63] (9 studies) on perspectives of HPs on
the delivery of smoking cessation care to PW. Baxter,
et al. [74] highlighted HPs’ lack of interpersonal and
counseling skills and skepticism towards their effectiveness in providing smoking cessation care, although unlike the present review, there was only limited reference
in the Baxter’s review about NRT. Our findings confirm
the results of Bauld, et al. [63] who found that there was
a need to improve smoking cessation knowledge and
confidence among HPs. Best strategies to support
women identified in Bauld, et al. [63] review were routine CO screening, behavioral support, and access to
pharmacotherapy. Pregnant women can under-report
their smoking behaviours [75]. CO screening could better identify smoking behaviours among pregnant women
allowing HP to provide better SCC support. In contrast
to Baxter, et al. [74], the present review also examined
the perspectives of PW about the smoking cessation care
provided to them by HPs. Analysis of both perspectives
through the lens of BCW can inform more effective
policies and interventions.
Strengths and weaknesses

All studies that fit the selection criteria were included in
the review irrespective of quality making it the most farreaching review of HPs’ and PW’s perspectives on smoking cessation care given and received during pregnancy.
A strength of this study is that it advanced the use of
the COM-B in a unique way by juxtaposing HP and
women’s voices within the categories of the BCW. This
review simultaneously analyzed both the perspectives of
PW about receiving HP smoking cessation care and the
HPs providing smoking cessation care to get a complete
picture of the interaction between the PW and their
HPs, the differences, and similarities. We only included
studies published in English, and hence, the
generalization of results to a broader range of nonEnglish speaking countries is limited. This was also a
global systematic review and hence local and cultural

contexts have not been studied in detail. The main reason for this is majority of the studies were conducted in
high-income countries which have similar health systems. Moreover, our aim was to look for commonalities
across the globe as opposed to determining which attitudes were more prevalent in different countries.
Implications for practice, policy, and research

There is a need to improve the knowledge and capabilities
of HPs to provide effective smoking cessation care to their
pregnant clients. This review could guide interventions to
improve HPs capability and motivation to deliver smoking
cessation interventions to PW along with encouraging
policies to improve opportunities for HPs to deliver these
interventions. This would include making available to HPs
ongoing training opportunities, supplemented with clear
guidelines, and effective resources. Secondly, smoking cessation training should include effective techniques to
manage the clients’ stress and other negative mental effects, since stress and depression in PW are major deterrents to the provision of smoking cessation care [76].
Training could address HPs’ concerns that smoking cessation counseling will adversely impact their relationship
with their pregnant clients, along with boosting their confidence to address smoking cessation care. Thirdly, policy
gaps were identified by health professionals. Communication and guideline policies in health institutions and services, in particular, formulating smoking cessation policy
with staff would improve SCC outcomes. Asking about
smoking cessation status and the provision of smoking
cessation advice should be normalized throughout the service and mandatorily undertaken by all HPs so that there
is no role confusion about smoking intervention delivery.
Fourthly, since many HPs hesitate to suggest NRT for
quitting due to limited research in this field, well designed
randomized controlled trials are required to strengthen
the evidence base with regards to effectiveness and safety
of higher doses of NRT in pregnancy [77].

Conclusion
This study provided an in-depth analysis of smoking cessation care offered by HPs to PW who smoke. The results
of this study are useful in identifying barriers to delivery of
smoking cessation care by HPs as well as designing effective smoking cessation interventions that are most likely to
be accepted by PW and implemented by HPs.

Abstract
Background: Smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable chronic disease-related morbidity and
mortality, excess healthcare expenditure, and lost work productivity. Tobacco users are disproportionately more
likely to be engaging in other modifiable risk behaviours such as excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity,
and poor diet. While hundreds of interventions addressing the clustering of smoking and other modifiable risk
behaviours have been conducted worldwide, there is insufficient information available about the context and
mechanisms in these interventions that promote successful smoking cessation. The aim of this rapid realist review
was to identify possible contexts and mechanisms used in multiple health behaviour change interventions
(targeting tobacco and two or more additional risk behaviours) that are associated with improving smoking
cessation outcome.
Methods: This realist review method incorporated the following steps: (1) clarifying the scope, (2) searching for
relevant evidence, (3) relevance confirmation, data extraction, and quality assessment, (4) data analysis and
synthesis.
Results: Of the 20,423 articles screened, 138 articles were included in this realist review. Following Michie et al.’s
behavior change model (the COM-B model), capability, opportunity, and motivation were used to identify the
mechanisms of behaviour change. Universally, increasing opportunities (i.e. factors that lie outside the individual
that prompt the behaviour or make it possible) for participants to engage in healthy behaviours was associated
with smoking cessation success. However, increasing participant’s capability or motivation to make a behaviour
change was only successful within certain contexts.

Conclusion: In order to address multiple health behaviours and assist individuals in quitting smoking, public health
promotion interventions need to shift away from ‘individualistic epidemiology’ and invest resources into modifying
factors that are external from the individual (i.e. creating a supportive environment).

Background
Smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable chronic disease-related morbidity and mortality,
excess healthcare expenditure, and lost work productivity [1–5]. While tobacco control efforts have made
significant strides in reducing the overall prevalence
of smoking in North America, millions of individuals
report smoking in 2018 [6–8]. Furthermore, disparities in smoking remain prevalent across population
groups [6].
Tobacco users are disproportionately more likely to be
engaging in other modifiable risk behaviours such as excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and poor
diet [9]. A recent review identified strong associations
between tobacco use and other modifiable risk behaviours [9], supporting an earlier report that only 12% of
smokers had no other modifiable risk behaviours [10].
Tobacco users tend to consume more alcohol, eat less
fruits and vegetables, and engage in fewer leisure time
physical activity compared to non-tobacco users [11].
The clustering of these modifiable risk behaviours
among tobacco users translates to a heightened risk for
cardiovascular disease [12] as well as other chronic diseases and may also negatively influence the likelihood of
successful smoking cessation [13–17].
Methods to improve cessation rates are of utmost importance as the percentage of tobacco users who are able
to quit and maintain abstinence unaided is low, estimated at 3–5% annually [18]. Identifying and implementing smoking cessation interventions that are
holistic and address other modifiable risk behaviours
may improve quit outcomes and enhance overall quality
of life. A Cochrane review of interventions that targeted
multiple modifiable risk behaviours (including smoking)
estimated a net reduction in smoking prevalence of 24%
[19]. However, older guidelines for smoking cessation
traditionally recommended only focusing on smoking
cessation [20–23].
While hundreds of interventions addressing the clustering of smoking and other modifiable risk behaviours
have been conducted worldwide [12, 13, 24–27], there is
insufficient information available about mechanisms incorporated in these interventions that help to promote
successful smoking cessation [19]. A rapid realist review,
which emphasizes the contexts and mechanisms within

the intervention that contribute to the outcomes, can
provide a more in-depth understanding of how and why
interventions are successful or unsuccessful [28, 29].
As a result, a rapid realist review was undertaken to
analyze and characterize the various contexts and mechanisms within multiple health behaviour change interventions that contribute to successful smoking cessation.
The mechanisms within interventions were characterized using the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation
Model of Behaviour (COM-B model), which states that
an individual’s behaviour (B) is part of an interacting
system involving 3 conditions: capability (C), opportunity (O), and motivation (M) [30]. COM-B is located at
the centre of the Behaviour Change Wheel; which provides recommendations for efficient designs of effective
behaviour change interventions [30]. COM-B can also
be mapped to the Behaviour Change Technique (BCT)
Taxonomy; which provides a systematic approach for
designing interventions [30, 31]. The COM-B model,
therefore, provides a foundation and starting point for
intervention development.
The information gathered from this rapid realist review is intended to guide the curriculum and program
development for Picking up the PACE (Promoting
and Accelerating Change through Empowerment), a
project funded by the Public Health Agency of
Canada and the Medical Psychiatry Alliance. Picking
Up the PACE aims to increase the capacity of practitioners to address other modifiable risk behaviours
(e.g. physical inactivity, excessive alcohol use and poor
diet) as a part of smoking cessation treatment. Picking Up the PACE aims to improve practitioner’s capacity to address multiple modifiable risk behaviours
through two essential approaches: 1) developing an
online training curriculum for healthcare practitioner
outlining strategies and techniques for addressing
multiple modifiable risk behaviours as a part of smoking cessation treatment and 2) designing a just-intime clinical decision support system that will guide
practitioners to address the engagement of multiple
risk behaviours by their patients. The findings from
this rapid realist review will also provide transferrable
learnings for practitioners and decision-makers who
are trying to develop multiple health behaviour
change interventions.

In this paper, we report the findings of a rapid realist
review of the current literature to produce a nuanced
and critical understanding of how interventions for multiple modifiable risk behaviours increase smoking cessation outcomes. Specifically, the aim of this rapid realist
review was to identify possible contexts and mechanisms
used in multiple health behaviour change interventions
(targeting tobacco and two or more additional risk behaviours) that are associated with improving smoking
cessation outcome.

Methods
Rationale for a rapid realist review

Traditional approaches to literature reviews (systematic
reviews and meta-analyses) assume outcomes are generated by linear causation [32]. While these approaches
work well for studies conducted with highly controlled
settings and exposures (e.g. randomized control trials);
they severely limit our understanding of complex and
pragmatic interventions [33]. Complex and pragmatic interventions require methods that offer a more comprehensive explanation of the ‘process’ that was undertaken
[34]. Therefore, a realist synthesis is well-suited to meet
these needs as it is uses a theory-driven approach to
synthesize complex evidence from diverse sources and
provide an understanding of why and how complex interventions works [28, 29].
Specifically, a realist synthesis aims to understand
how, for whom, where, and why the intervention is effective or ineffective [28, 29]. This is accomplished by
examining the “mechanisms”, exploring the “contexts”
where the intervention occurred, and then linking these
contexts and mechanisms to the “outcome” of the intervention [28]. As per the realist definition, mechanisms
are the “underlying entities, processes, or [social] structures which operate in particular contexts to generate
the outcomes of interest” [35]. This combination of the
context (C), mechanisms (M), and outcome (O) in an
intervention is called a C-M-O configuration. Recurrent
patterns of C-M-O configurations are known as demiregularities, or semi-predictable pattern/pathway of how
a program functions. In other words, demi-regularities
are a broad rule for how and when certain outcomes
usually occur [28].
While full realist reviews can require a considerable
dedication of time to the exploration of literature and
subsequent analysis, rapid realist reviews (RRRs) have
been used to enable a quicker transition from research to policy and/or practice [36]. Given the need
for a timely synthesis and its application for the Picking Up the PACE programme, we undertook a rapid
realist review; which allows us to maintain the core
elements of the realist methodology and produce
timely data.

Page 3 of 26

Prior to this rapid realist review, a pre-specified protocol was registered (PROSPERO registration number:
CRD42017064430) and published [37] which included
the research question, search strategy, synthesis methodology, preliminary program theory, definitions, inclusion
criteria for relevance screening, data extraction form,
quality assessment tool, and plans for dissemination. An
overview of the methods and any modifications to the
original protocol are described below. Utilizing the
RAMESES (Realist and Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards) [38], and adapting it to follow a
rapid realist review [34], the following steps were
applied:
Clarifying the scope
Identifying the research question

This rapid realist review supports a larger program,
Picking Up the PACE, that aims to increase the ability of
healthcare providers to offer evidence-based interventions to tobacco users which encompass changing modifiable risk behaviours (excess alcohol consumption,
physical inactivity, poor diet, stress, and poor sleep) to
ultimately achieve long-term smoking abstinence. As a
result, this review focuses on smoking cessation in the
context of multiple health behaviour change interventions that also address these other risk behaviours.
In order to clarify the scope of the rapid realist review,
a multidisciplinary team with expertise in knowledge
synthesis, public health, and multiple health behaviour
change met in-person on nine occasions for 1 h over the
course of 6 months. Our initial research question was:
“What factors are associated with effective multiple
health behaviour change (three or more behaviours including smoking)?”
Changes in the rapid realist review process

After a preliminary review of the data, further specificity
of the study question was required to meet the desired
outcome. The contexts and mechanisms involved in
changing multiple health behaviours might be different
than those involved in smoking cessation. Thus we
modified our research question to: “What contexts and
mechanisms are associated with improving smoking cessation outcome in interventions that target two or more
additional unhealthy behaviours.”
Initial theory

We identified our initial theory of how, when, and why
multiple health behaviour change interventions work by
reviewing seven large-scale multi-factorial cardiovascular
disease and cancer risk interventions [39–45]. These
studies included the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention
Trial (MRFIT) [39], the North Karelia Project [40], the
Stanford Five City Project [41], Project PREVENT [43],

Minian et al. BMC Public Health

(2020) 20:918

the Minnesota Heart Health Program [45], the Mediterranean Lifestyle Trial [44], and the BETTER Trial [42],
all of which are well-known studies that promoted multiple health behaviour change in large community samples [46]. As specified in our protocol manuscript [37],
our preliminary review of these seven interventions involved having two independent reviewers extract the following information from the studies:
1. The specific activities within each intervention.
Activities are physical/tangible tasks that were
undertaken by the intervention (e.g. counselling,
sharing of educational flyers, workshop, courses,
prize draw). Please note, we coded all activities
undertaken by intervention for any behaviour, not
only those related to smoking.
2. The setting in which the intervention took place,
including physical environment, social setting, and
political climate (if provided).
3. The outcomes of each intervention, including any
behavioural and/or clinical outcomes.
Through this preliminary review, we found that successful interventions usually had: pre-existing infrastructure that facilitates the delivery of the
intervention, and targeting regions (e.g. geographic,
population groups) where the need for the intervention is well-characterized. Furthermore, activities
undertaken by these interventions often targeted the
surrounding community and/or organizational structure. This multi-level approach appears to be in an
effort to change the physical and social opportunities
that can help facilitate multiple health behaviour
change in individuals. Individual-level activities frequently focused on increasing patient’s awareness and
knowledge, improving feelings of support, empowerment, and incorporating incentives for completing
activities.
Upon closer review, we realized that these activities
mapped onto the COM-B model; which stipulates that
behaviour change requires change in one or more of the
following component: capability, opportunity, and motivation [30]. All seven studies used in developing our
initial program theory sought to change at least one
component of this behavioural system. We used the taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [31] to code
each activity specified in the studies and we crossreferenced these codes with the COM-B model. We used
Table 2 in Michie and colleagues’ article to help us create the links between the components of the COM-B
model and the BCT taxonomy [30]. For example an
intervention that helped participants set a quit date was
categorized as BCT 1.3“Goal setting” and consequently
coded under “Capability” within the COM-B model. A

visual depiction of this theory can be found in the published protocol [37].
The coded data was reviewed by our expert panel,
which had a total of 11 members and was comprised of
representatives from the Medical Psychiatry Alliance,
Public Health Ontario, and the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health. Over the course of 9 in-person meetings,
the expert panel assisted the research team with the review and development of the initial program theory.
Searching for relevant evidence: search strategy and
eligibility criteria

To test our program theory, a search strategy was developed and implemented to retrieve relevant primary data
from both academic and grey literature. The search
strategy was informed by the research team and developed by a medical librarian who executed the search
across multiple bibliographic databases [37]. After our
protocol was published, minor changes were made to
the search strategy (see Additional File 1). The initial
search aimed to identify as many multiple health behaviour interventions as possible, allowing the team to accurately identify trends across the literature.
To identify grey literature from Canada, Europe, and
the USA, variations of the phrase “multiple health behaviours” were used to hand search the websites and online repositories of international, national, and provincial
health organizations, health behaviour/condition-specific
associations, clinical trial registries, and grey literature
repositories. Reference lists of three systematic reviews
and meta-analyses [27, 106, 107] were also hand
searched to identify any relevant resources not captured
by the systematic searches. No additional articles were
included from the grey literature or reference list
searches. After the search was complete, we chose to exclude books and reviews. It should be noted that 22 interventions were identified as having more than one
publication reporting similar results. In these cases, the
lead scientist and two additional members of the team
selected one article per intervention to represent the
contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes of the intervention,
and excluded other articles associated with that
intervention.
Relevance confirmation, data extraction, and quality
assessment

Two independent reviewers assessed each study to determine its relevance to our research question, extract
pertinent information, and appraise its quality using predesigned and pre-tested relevance screening and data extraction forms [37]. The systematic review software DistillerSR [108] was used for this process. As described in
our protocol [37], to be included in this review the study
had to:

(excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity,
poor diet, stress, and poor sleep).
 Report on long-term (i.e. follow-up at 5 months or
longer) smoking cessation outcomes





Since we had multiple study designs included in
this rapid realist review, a combination of the Mixed
Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) [109] and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) [110] was
used to evaluate the methodological quality of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies. Each
type of study was assessed by two reviewers using a
pre-designed quality assessment form [37]. As per
MMAT and CASP appraisal methods, the quality criteria differed based on the study design; quantitative
– randomized controlled trial (eight criteria), quantitative – non-randomized (10 criteria), qualitative (10
criteria), and mixed-method (six criteria). These criteria were scored using a nominal scale (Yes/No/Can’t
Tell).
Based on the scoring metrics of the MMAT [109] and
adjusting for the additional CASP criteria [110], an overall quality score was calculated for each study using the
descriptors *, **, ***, and ****. For all types of studies, the
score was derived by taking the number of criteria met
and dividing it by the number of criteria. Scores were
assigned the following descriptors: 0–25% (*), 26–50%
(**), 51–75% (***), and 76% + (****). To score the mixed
methods studies, the overall quality could not exceed the
quality of the weakest section of the study. For example,
in a mixed method study, if the qualitative score is (**),
and the quantitative and mixed method scores are both
(***), the study is assigned an overall score of the lowest
section (**).The questions used to score each study can
be found in Additional File 2.
Prior to data extraction and coding of the context,
mechanisms, and outcomes within the studies, reviewers
were trained on the COM-B model, the Behaviour
Change Wheel and the BCT taxonomy [30, 31]. They
were also trained on how to characterize the various
techniques that are used within interventions and map
these techniques onto the COM-B model. Once trained,
the following process was also undertaken by the two independent reviewers:
 Review article to identify and record the activities

that took place in the intervention.
 Code the modifiable risk behaviours the intervention

was targeting.
 Code which techniques were applied to each

activity, as defined by the BCT taxonomy. Please
note, we coded all activities and corresponding





techniques in the intervention, not only those that
are specific to smoking cessation.
Determine how each technique is associated with
the COM-B model.
Code the target population (e.g. gender, ethnicity,
general public vs patients)
Code the smoking outcome(s), including whether
there was a statistically significant change and the
follow-up period in which the outcome was assessed
(e.g. end of treatment, 6 months, 12 months, or 24
months)
Code the context where the intervention took place
(e.g. region, clinical setting, clinical, communitybased settings, and/or school-based settings)
At each step, discrepancies between two reviewers
were resolved by consensus or, when necessary, by a
third reviewer.

Data analysis and synthesis process

The data from DistillerSR [108] was exported to Microsoft Excel for descriptive analysis and analyzed using
NVivo 11 [111]. To determine whether the intervention
fit the initial program theory and to identify if there were
any emerging patterns in the types and combination of
C-M-O’s configurations used, the reviewers examined
the studies to see whether the interventions had also focused on changed physical and social opportunities and/
or other behaviour change techniques such as raising
awareness, increasing knowledge, and encouraging empowerment. The behaviour change techniques did not
have to be specific to smoking and could be targeting
any modifiable risk behaviours. For example, if a multiple health behaviour change intervention offered membership to a gym to help improve physical activity, this
was coded as Opportunity.
Smoking cessation outcomes were measured in a variety of ways across articles, including different time
points (e.g. at end of treatment, 3 months, 12 months),
duration of abstinence (e.g. 7-day point prevalence abstinence vs last 30 days), and presentation of data (e.g.
descriptive vs statistical analyses). These outcomes were
verified (e.g. biochemically) or were self-reported. The
literature shows that both types of outcomes are valid
[112–114] and therefore we did not differentiate between self-reported measures and biochemically verified
measures. However, studies that used non-validated
measures/screeners for self-report questions would be
penalized in the quality assessment score. Please see
Additional File 2 questions used to score each study.
As a result, we organized our findings by whether statistically significant smoking cessation outcomes were
observed and whether the outcome was measured longterm (i.e. ≥5 months). Within these outcome types, the
interventions were organized by the three categories that

Minian et al. BMC Public Health

(2020) 20:918

were then used to identify the mechanisms (capability,
opportunity, and motivation) and the context in which
the intervention occurred. Many of the reviewed articles
did not describe the context in which the intervention
was implemented in sufficient detail. Thus we decided
to be as broad as possible and divided context into three
categories: 1) the continent in which the intervention
took place, 2) the type of setting (e.g. clinical, workplace)
and 3) whether it was a multidisciplinary intervention.
We established the following criteria to report demiregularities:
 There were a minimum of three interventions using

the specific C-M-O configuration.
 Among interventions with a specific C-M-O config-

uration, either ≥60% OR ≤ 40% of these interventions
reported statistically significant increase in smoking
cessation.

To present an example of how this process works,
if we discover a C-M-O configuration (e.g. Clinical
Setting – Capability – Smoking Cessation Outcome)
within an intervention, there must be at least two
other interventions with this C-M-O configuration to
allow for further analysis. In this hypothetical example, if we have a total of ten interventions that
have ‘Clinical Setting-Capability-Smoking Cessation
Outcome’ configuration, we then have to determine
what percentage of these studies reported a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation. In
order for this C-M-O configuration to be categorized
as a demi-regularity, at least 60% of these interventions must report a statistically significant increase in
long-term smoking cessation outcome (i.e. ≥5
months). The demi-regularity in this case would be
that interventions in clinical settings that target capability are more likely to lead to improvement in
smoking cessation outcome. Alternatively, if ≤40% of
the interventions reported a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation outcome, the demiregularity would suggest that interventions in clinical
settings that target capability are less likely to lead to
improvements in smoking cessation outcomes.
In this paper, we analyzed demi-regularities in interventions that were rated four stars in our quality rating,
used statistical analyses, and reported long-term smoking cessation outcomes (i.e. ≥5 months). We chose to
only include those interventions with a four star rating
as they have the least amount of bias. Once a demiregularity was discovered, studies that had lower quality
assessment scores (less than four stars), and/or did not
perform statistical analyses were included in our pool
for analysis to confirm if the previously observed demiregularity persisted.

Results
The flow of information through the rapid realist review
process is shown in Fig. 1.
A descriptive overview of all the interventions is provided in Table 1. Table 2 outlines the contexts, activities,
and mechanisms used by interventions with statistically
significant long-term (i.e. ≥5 months) smoking cessation
outcomes.
Exploration of the differences and commonalities
among the interventions reveals several trends. For example, all interventions that took place in Africa (n = 2)
addressed only three behaviours and these behaviours
did not include alcohol, stress, or sleep. Furthermore,
none of the interventions in Africa use motivation as a
mechanism. There was only one multiple health behaviour change intervention that took place in Central/
South America (n = 1). This intervention was conducted
in a clinical setting and was designed to address four behaviours simultaneously. On the other hand, Europe
(n = 60) and North America (n = 49) had larger variations in the number and types of behaviours addressed
by any given intervention. Europe and North America
were the only continents in which sleep was also targeted within behavioural change interventions. North
America was also the only region in which there were
interventions that targeted all six modifiable risk behaviours simultaneously.
Overall, the majority of interventions employed at least
two mechanisms. Specifically 31(22%) interventions only
used one mechanism, 66 (48%) interventions used two
mechanisms, and 41 (30%) targeted all three mechanisms. As shown in Tables 1, 66 studies (48%) were
scored as 4 stars, 59 (43%) were three stars, and 13 (9%)
were scored as two stars. Common reasons why studies
scored less than four stars included: lack of clarity
around whether bias was sufficiently addressed, use of
non-validated measures, insufficient description of
randomization process (if applicable), and high withdrawal/drop-out.
Demi-regularity – opportunity

For the purposes of this rapid realist review, “opportunity” was defined as “all the factors that lie outside
the individual that make the behaviour possible or
prompt it” [30]. When interventions focused on increasing the “opportunity” to access services and
change the social environment, tobacco users who engaged in other unhealthy behaviours were more likely
to achieve long-term smoking cessation. In particular,
interventions that: 1) provided “access” to healthy living tools (e.g. free medications such as nicotine replacement therapy, gym memberships, walking
groups, free/accessible fruits and vegetables, etc.) and/
or 2) encouraged “social support” (e.g. incorporating

Supporting evidence

There were 32 interventions [40, 49, 51, 54–56, 61, 63,
65, 71, 75, 82, 83, 92, 95, 96, 101, 103, 105, 115–127]
that used opportunity as one of the mechanisms for behaviour change with the majority of these interventions
(59%) [40, 49, 51, 54–56, 61, 63, 65, 71, 75, 82, 83, 92,
95, 96, 101, 103, 105] reporting successful long-term cessation. There were 12 interventions that aimed to increase access to resources as a part of the intervention
[49, 56, 61, 63, 82, 83, 92, 95, 96, 103, 119, 121]. Of
these, 10 (83%) interventions reported successful longterm smoking cessation [49, 56, 61, 63, 82, 83, 92, 95,
96, 103]. The majority of interventions that made
changes to the physical and/or social environment (8/11;
73%) [40, 56, 61, 71, 83, 96, 103, 105] or interventions
that improved patient’s social support system (10/15;

67%) [51, 54, 55, 65, 75, 82, 96, 101, 103, 105] also reported successful long-term cessation.
In various settings (e.g. clinical settings, community
settings, workplace, etc.) and across several continents,
programs that aimed to increase the opportunity to
change behaviours were successful in achieving longterm smoking abstinence among their participants
(Table 3). These trends remain fairly consistent when
examining all interventions; including those interventions that were given a rating from one to three stars in
our quality assessment and reported statistical significance (see Additional File 3).
Demi-regularity – capability

For this review, capability was defined as the “individual’s psychological and physical capacity to engage in
healthy behaviours” [30]. The success of interventions
that included capability as a mechanism appears to be
dependent on various factors, including: the specific

context in which these interventions were implemented,
the populations that were targeted, and the types of behaviours targeted in the intervention. When examining
specific techniques for increasing capability, including
“capacity to plan”, “enhancing knowledge” and “empowerment”, the effectiveness of these techniques was
dependent on the context in which it was implemented.

Of the 53 interventions in our sample that were
based on this mechanism [12, 40, 43, 49, 51, 52, 54–
56, 61, 63, 65, 69, 71, 75, 81–83, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101,
103, 105, 115–142], only 23 (43%) interventions resulted in long-term smoking cessation [40, 49, 51, 52,
54–56, 61, 63, 65, 69, 71, 75, 81–83, 92, 95, 96, 98,
101, 103, 105]. Unlike the trends observed with opportunity, the majority of interventions that used capability as one of the mechanisms were not successful.
These trends persisted when we looked at specific
techniques for increasing capability. Only one [75] of
the four interventions [75, 123, 130, 131] that sought
to change to one’s beliefs about the intervention (a
technique used to increase capability) reported successful long-term smoking cessation.
However, there were certain contexts in which interventions based on this mechanism observed more success. Specifically, four [56, 65, 69, 75, 81] out of eight
interventions [56, 65, 69, 75, 81, 118, 122, 125] in Asia
reported that participants were more likely to quit smoking. Interventions that utilized capability in community
based settings or in schools also had positive results with
71% (5/7) [40, 61, 63, 81, 92] and 80% (4/5) [40, 56, 71,
83], respectively reporting long-term smoking cessation.
There was only one observable trend among interventions that used capability to target primary prevention or
secondary prevention. Interventions that targeted secondary prevention and aimed to empower participants
did not appear to be effective. Only two (40%) [65, 75]
of the five interventions [65, 75, 133, 135, 140] reported
successful long-term smoking cessation.
Conversely, there were certain contexts in which using
capability as a mechanism appeared to negatively impact
the success of the intervention. In Europe (6/19; 32%)
[40, 52, 54, 55, 92, 95] and in Australasia (2/5; 40%) [49,
101], only a minority of the interventions using capability reported participants were more likely to quit smoking. Even when we examined specific techniques for
increasing capability that were used in Europe, very few
interventions reported successful long-term smoking
cessation. Similar trends were observed with interventions that took place in clinical settings; only 37% (10/
27) [40, 52, 55, 61, 65, 69, 75, 81, 82, 95] of the interventions reported participants were more likely to quit
smoking.

The type and number of risk behaviours targeted by
interventions that aimed to increase patient’s capability
were also examined (Table 4). Unlike what was observed
for opportunity, using capability as a mechanism in an
intervention only appeared to be successful for certain
behaviours and when specific techniques for increasing
capability were used. For example, among interventions
that targeted stress, the majority of interventions (6/10;
60%) [40, 95, 96, 101, 103, 105] that used “capacity to
plan” demonstrated success in achieving long-term
smoking cessation. Furthermore, 60% (3/5) [75, 101,
103] of interventions that targeted alcohol and used ‘empowerment’ as a technique for increasing capability reported long-term smoking cessation. However, only 33%
(1/3) of interventions [75] that targeted alcohol and used
the technique of changing ‘beliefs about the intervention’
reported long-term smoking cessation.
Demi-regularity – motivation

Motivation, defined as “all those brain processes that
energize and direct behaviour, not just goals and conscious decision-making” [30], appears to be effective in
certain contexts for improving smoking cessation
outcomes.
Supporting evidence

Thirty seven interventions [12, 40, 43, 52, 55, 56, 58, 63,
69, 77, 82, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101, 103, 105, 115, 117, 118,
120, 123–125, 127, 130, 131, 133, 134, 136–138, 140–
143] in our sample utilized motivation as a mechanism.
However, based on our criteria, there were very few
techniques involving motivation that had any reportable
trends. As a result, we have chosen to provide a descriptive overview of these trends.
Interventions that aimed to increase participant’s motivation had mixed results, as 43% (16/37) [40, 52, 55,
56, 58, 63, 69, 77, 82, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101, 103, 105] of
studies reported an association between increasing participant’s motivation and long-term smoking cessation.
Similar to capability, implementing strategies that increased motivation within interventions appeared to be
beneficial in certain contexts. For example, the majority
of interventions that utilized motivation in communitybased settings (3/4; 75%) [40, 63, 92] and schools (2/3;
67%) [40, 56] reported that participants were more likely
to quit smoking long-term. In contrast, applying motivation as a mechanism was unsuccessful in clinical settings; eight (36%) [40, 52, 55, 58, 69, 77, 82, 95] of the 22
[12, 40, 43, 52, 55, 58, 69, 77, 82, 95, 117, 123–125, 127,
130, 133, 134, 136, 140, 141, 143] interventions in these
settings reported participants were more likely to quit
smoking.
In terms of the number of behaviours that were targeted, interventions targeting three behaviours

Page 15 of 26

demonstrated limited success; only six (32%) [52, 55, 56,
58, 63, 69] of the 19 interventions [12, 52, 55, 56, 58, 63,
69, 120, 123–125, 127, 133, 134, 136, 137, 140, 141, 143]
reported long-term smoking cessation. The types of behaviours targeted by these interventions were also examined. The majority of interventions that focused on
increasing patient’s motivation and targeted stress (8/12;
67%) [40, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101, 103, 105] reported a greater
likelihood of long-term smoking cessation.

Discussion
Health behaviour change programs that address multiple
behaviours have been the subject of much discussion because there are a multitude of ways in which these programs can be developed, including: the types and
numbers of modifiable risk behaviours to target [144],
the types of activities to use [30], and the types of professions to involve [145–147]. In the current literature,
there is a clear gap in the understanding of why some interventions have worked and others have not [46]. The
results of this rapid realist review represent the first step
in addressing this gap. Specifically, the goal of this paper
was to review published interventions targeting multiple
modifiable risk behaviours to uncover demi-regularities
that contribute to the success of the program in helping
people quit smoking. In other words, what contexts and
mechanisms (i.e. structures, activities or processes within
interventions that contribute to the outcomes of interest) lead to long-term smoking cessation.
The results of this rapid realist review emphasize the
importance of incorporating mechanisms that modify
external factors in multiple health behaviour interventions that attempt to achieve long-term smoking cessation. Specifically, interventions that made resources (e.g.
pharmacotherapy, exercise, healthy foods) more accessible, changed the physical environment (e.g. introduced
smoke free polices), or increased one’s social support
network, were more likely to help individuals quit smoking. Evidence to support these findings were noticeable
across different regions, settings, and behaviours. These
findings challenge individualistic epidemiology that
many health promotion interventions are based on,
namely that health behaviours are a matter of individual
choice [148]. While individuals do have ‘free choice’, research shows that the environment can significantly influence the decisions they make [149–151].
The findings from this rapid realist review also show
that the success of interventions targeting motivation
and capability appears to be dependent on the context.
For example, interventions in Asia that tried to increase
capability were usually successful in helping people quit
smoking, while European interventions were not. The
literature shows that while smoking is no longer socially
acceptable in North America and Europe [152, 153], for

many countries in Asia (e.g. China), smoking continues
to be an accepted social activity [154, 155]. Thus, it
could be hypothesized that interventions that increase
person’s psychological capabilities (such as enhancing
knowledge and skills) are more successful in contexts
where the social climate was favourable to smoking. This
finding is similar to previous research, which shows that
the impact of knowledge on promoting successful behaviour change is dependent on the context in which it is
provided [156, 157].
With regards to the trends we have observed with interventions that target motivation, the majority of these
interventions did not appear to be successful in clinical
settings but were successful in schools and communitybased settings. A possible explanation for this is interventions delivered in non-clinic settings are reaching
populations that are not motivated as they are not currently seeking out health care. Populations that are
already in health care settings or seeking health care are
likely to be intrinsically motivated to make changes to
their behaviours [24, 158–163]. Thus, it is likely only in
settings where motivation is low that having programs
focusing on increasing motivation made a difference.
Significant strides have been made in the field of
tobacco control to reduce the prevalence of smoking
globally [164–166]. Tobacco control efforts have focused on changing the environment and the opportunities available to individuals (e.g. legislation
introducing smoke-free places, warning-labels on tobacco products) [164–166], which coincides with the
demi-regularities we have found in our review. However, for many other modifiable risk behaviours including alcohol and physical inactivity, public health
promotion has traditionally relied on education, information, and psychosocial interventions to persuade
individuals to adopt healthy lifestyles [167, 168].
Moreover, many widely used theories for behaviour
change, including the Theory of Reasoned Action,
Theory of Planned Behaviour, and the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change have focused
primarily on the individual [169–171]. These theories
do not account for the influence of environmental
factors and thus may further contribute to the individualistic approach in addressing these modifiable
risk behaviours. While some studies (n = 52 [38%]) in
this review report using an established theory (e.g.
Trans-theoretical Model of Behaviour Change), the
majority did not report whether they used a theoretical framework (n = 86 [62%]). Thus we were unable
to examine how the application of these theoretical
frameworks within the interventions may have influenced the results of this study. In the current population of smokers, who engage in additional modifiable
risk behaviours, this review shows that it is important

Page 18 of 26

for interventions to focus on changing an individual’s
opportunity to adopt additional healthy behaviours.
Applying the COM-B model

Using the COM-B model as our framework to categorize
the mechanisms provided a systematic and standardized
method to code the diverse interventions [172, 173].
This method is aligned with other reviews examining effective behaviour change interventions [174, 175]. It also
allowed us to use clearly-defined techniques that maps
on to the COM-B model, and a behaviour change taxonomy; thereby ensuring transparency and enabling replication [30, 31]. Focusing our analysis of mechanisms
using the COM-B model also allowed for documentation
of internal and external drivers of behaviour change,
something many other theories do not allow [169–171].
In addition, we were able to develop a high level of understanding of the general trends that influence whether
a program that targets multiple health behaviors is effective to help people quit smoking. Therefore, using the
COM-B model provided the first step in understanding
the determinants of successful behaviour change. While
the COM-B model has been criticized for ignoring contextual characteristics [176], this argument cannot be
made for this rapid realist review as we also analyzed
context as part of the C-M-O configuration. The COMB model was used only to code the mechanisms and we
subsequently examined the contexts which these mechanisms were operationalized.
There were some limitations to using the COM-B
model as the framework for the mechanisms in the CM-O configuration. As mentioned by other researchers
[176], this model in its current form does not provide
specific and tangible actions to incorporate into the design of an intervention. However, the COM-B model can
be mapped onto the Behaviour Change Wheel [30],
which provide specific recommendations for intervention designs that can be used to address each component of the COM-B. Thus, findings from this study are
not intended to be final; rather they offer guidance on
the next steps in generating hypotheses for future intervention studies. The COM-B model provides directions
on the mechanisms and consequently, the areas of the
Behaviour Change Wheel that should be explored
further.
Also important to note is that Michie’s group is currently developing and mapping Mechanisms of Action
(MoA) to behaviour change techniques [177]. MoAs are
defined as “the process through which behaviour change
occurs” [177]. In the future, it might become useful to
apply the findings of this review to the MoA. Carey
et al.’s study [178], which was published after we had
started coding our work, has hypothesised some possible
links between BCTs and MoA. The MoAs expressed in

Carey et al. are more granular than the ones we used in
this study. However, since it is based on the Behaviour
Change Technique Taxonomy we should be able to
draw comparisons. For example, some of the common
MoAs identified by Carey et al. include: knowledge,
skills, behavioural regulations, attitudes towards the behaviour, beliefs about capability, and beliefs about consequences. These are all characteristics we identified and
coded in each study and then grouped as “Capability”
using the COM-B model’s definition.
Limitations

A major limitation of this review is that many of the articles reviewed did not describe the context or the behavioural change techniques used in detail. For example,
we were unable to determine whether the setting in
which an intervention took place already had other resources and supports that contributed to the success of
the intervention (e.g. highly experienced staff). As a result, the contexts we were able to examine were broad,
including: the continent in which the intervention took
place and the type of setting (e.g. clinical, workplace).
Given the wide variety in the types of populations that
interventions targeted, we were not able to examine
trends by target population.
Moreover, in some instances, the studies did not provide sufficient details on the types of activities undertaken as a part of the intervention. This under-reporting
of active ingredients was recently discussed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of smoking cessation interventions [172, 173, 179]. Bruin et al. (2019) described
the challenge of reporting all the BCTs in a complex
intervention as they can include 20 or more BCTs [179].
It has been shown that even a routine visit between patients and health care professionals can include 15 or
more BCTs [180–182].
It is important to also acknowledge that there were
several challenges associated with isolating the mechanisms (i.e. capability, opportunity, motivation) within the
interventions. Specifically, it was often difficult to determine which mechanisms were targeted in studies that
provided insufficient information on study design, and/
or implementation. To get around this challenge, we
reviewed articles with four star quality ratings first to determine the demi-regularities. However, these limitations
also meant that, in some situations, we were unable to
identify whether a specific mechanism was used. This
may further contribute to the under-reporting of the
mechanisms targeted within the interventions.
Lastly, the majority of interventions in this review targeted at least two mechanisms simultaneously (n = 97,
70%). It is unclear the degree of overlap between mechanisms and how these mechanisms interact to produce
the observed outcome in these interventions. As a result,

Page 21 of 26

there may have been additional mechanisms and techniques that were employed by these interventions that
we were unable to capture in our analyses. Future areas
of research should also include examining the order in
which behaviours should be addressed, (simultaneously
vs sequential), the combination of behaviours to target,
and the combination of mechanisms to target.

Conclusion
Our study is the first to apply a realist review methodology to explore how, why and under what circumstances programs that target multiple risk behaviours are
associated with long-term smoking cessation. It offers an
explanatory view of the existing and extensive body of
literature on interventions targeting multiple health behaviours. The evidence we reviewed came from a variety
of countries, continents, settings, and targeted different
behaviours, and yet we were able to observe clear and
consistent themes regarding the importance of increasing an individual’s opportunity in multiple health behaviour change interventions. With regards to Picking Up
the PACE, the results of this rapid realist review informed the development of courses for practitioners on
how to support individuals who have multiple risk behaviours and are trying to quit smoking. Moving forward, programs that aim to address multiple modifiable
risk behaviours as a part of a smoking cessation intervention should strongly consider incorporating activities
that target external factors (i.e. social support, and access
to treatment). The findings of the review highlight the
value and importance of the COM-B model for effective
behaviour change. We recommend that decision-makers,
policy makers and implementers who are aiming to design multiple health behaviour change interventions
should consistently apply the COM-B model, take context into consideration, and wherever feasible, include
activities that improve an individual’s opportunities to
make successful behaviour change.

Abstract
Background: Smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable chronic disease-related morbidity and
mortality, excess healthcare expenditure, and lost work productivity. Tobacco users are disproportionately more
likely to be engaging in other modifiable risk behaviours such as excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity,
and poor diet. While hundreds of interventions addressing the clustering of smoking and other modifiable risk
behaviours have been conducted worldwide, there is insufficient information available about the context and
mechanisms in these interventions that promote successful smoking cessation. The aim of this rapid realist review
was to identify possible contexts and mechanisms used in multiple health behaviour change interventions
(targeting tobacco and two or more additional risk behaviours) that are associated with improving smoking
cessation outcome.
Methods: This realist review method incorporated the following steps: (1) clarifying the scope, (2) searching for
relevant evidence, (3) relevance confirmation, data extraction, and quality assessment, (4) data analysis and
synthesis.
Results: Of the 20,423 articles screened, 138 articles were included in this realist review. Following Michie et al.’s
behavior change model (the COM-B model), capability, opportunity, and motivation were used to identify the
mechanisms of behaviour change. Universally, increasing opportunities (i.e. factors that lie outside the individual
that prompt the behaviour or make it possible) for participants to engage in healthy behaviours was associated
with smoking cessation success. However, increasing participant’s capability or motivation to make a behaviour
change was only successful within certain contexts.

Conclusion: In order to address multiple health behaviours and assist individuals in quitting smoking, public health
promotion interventions need to shift away from ‘individualistic epidemiology’ and invest resources into modifying
factors that are external from the individual (i.e. creating a supportive environment).

Background
Smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable chronic disease-related morbidity and mortality,
excess healthcare expenditure, and lost work productivity [1–5]. While tobacco control efforts have made
significant strides in reducing the overall prevalence
of smoking in North America, millions of individuals
report smoking in 2018 [6–8]. Furthermore, disparities in smoking remain prevalent across population
groups [6].
Tobacco users are disproportionately more likely to be
engaging in other modifiable risk behaviours such as excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and poor
diet [9]. A recent review identified strong associations
between tobacco use and other modifiable risk behaviours [9], supporting an earlier report that only 12% of
smokers had no other modifiable risk behaviours [10].
Tobacco users tend to consume more alcohol, eat less
fruits and vegetables, and engage in fewer leisure time
physical activity compared to non-tobacco users [11].
The clustering of these modifiable risk behaviours
among tobacco users translates to a heightened risk for
cardiovascular disease [12] as well as other chronic diseases and may also negatively influence the likelihood of
successful smoking cessation [13–17].
Methods to improve cessation rates are of utmost importance as the percentage of tobacco users who are able
to quit and maintain abstinence unaided is low, estimated at 3–5% annually [18]. Identifying and implementing smoking cessation interventions that are
holistic and address other modifiable risk behaviours
may improve quit outcomes and enhance overall quality
of life. A Cochrane review of interventions that targeted
multiple modifiable risk behaviours (including smoking)
estimated a net reduction in smoking prevalence of 24%
[19]. However, older guidelines for smoking cessation
traditionally recommended only focusing on smoking
cessation [20–23].
While hundreds of interventions addressing the clustering of smoking and other modifiable risk behaviours
have been conducted worldwide [12, 13, 24–27], there is
insufficient information available about mechanisms incorporated in these interventions that help to promote
successful smoking cessation [19]. A rapid realist review,
which emphasizes the contexts and mechanisms within

the intervention that contribute to the outcomes, can
provide a more in-depth understanding of how and why
interventions are successful or unsuccessful [28, 29].
As a result, a rapid realist review was undertaken to
analyze and characterize the various contexts and mechanisms within multiple health behaviour change interventions that contribute to successful smoking cessation.
The mechanisms within interventions were characterized using the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation
Model of Behaviour (COM-B model), which states that
an individual’s behaviour (B) is part of an interacting
system involving 3 conditions: capability (C), opportunity (O), and motivation (M) [30]. COM-B is located at
the centre of the Behaviour Change Wheel; which provides recommendations for efficient designs of effective
behaviour change interventions [30]. COM-B can also
be mapped to the Behaviour Change Technique (BCT)
Taxonomy; which provides a systematic approach for
designing interventions [30, 31]. The COM-B model,
therefore, provides a foundation and starting point for
intervention development.
The information gathered from this rapid realist review is intended to guide the curriculum and program
development for Picking up the PACE (Promoting
and Accelerating Change through Empowerment), a
project funded by the Public Health Agency of
Canada and the Medical Psychiatry Alliance. Picking
Up the PACE aims to increase the capacity of practitioners to address other modifiable risk behaviours
(e.g. physical inactivity, excessive alcohol use and poor
diet) as a part of smoking cessation treatment. Picking Up the PACE aims to improve practitioner’s capacity to address multiple modifiable risk behaviours
through two essential approaches: 1) developing an
online training curriculum for healthcare practitioner
outlining strategies and techniques for addressing
multiple modifiable risk behaviours as a part of smoking cessation treatment and 2) designing a just-intime clinical decision support system that will guide
practitioners to address the engagement of multiple
risk behaviours by their patients. The findings from
this rapid realist review will also provide transferrable
learnings for practitioners and decision-makers who
are trying to develop multiple health behaviour
change interventions.

In this paper, we report the findings of a rapid realist
review of the current literature to produce a nuanced
and critical understanding of how interventions for multiple modifiable risk behaviours increase smoking cessation outcomes. Specifically, the aim of this rapid realist
review was to identify possible contexts and mechanisms
used in multiple health behaviour change interventions
(targeting tobacco and two or more additional risk behaviours) that are associated with improving smoking
cessation outcome.

Methods
Rationale for a rapid realist review

Traditional approaches to literature reviews (systematic
reviews and meta-analyses) assume outcomes are generated by linear causation [32]. While these approaches
work well for studies conducted with highly controlled
settings and exposures (e.g. randomized control trials);
they severely limit our understanding of complex and
pragmatic interventions [33]. Complex and pragmatic interventions require methods that offer a more comprehensive explanation of the ‘process’ that was undertaken
[34]. Therefore, a realist synthesis is well-suited to meet
these needs as it is uses a theory-driven approach to
synthesize complex evidence from diverse sources and
provide an understanding of why and how complex interventions works [28, 29].
Specifically, a realist synthesis aims to understand
how, for whom, where, and why the intervention is effective or ineffective [28, 29]. This is accomplished by
examining the “mechanisms”, exploring the “contexts”
where the intervention occurred, and then linking these
contexts and mechanisms to the “outcome” of the intervention [28]. As per the realist definition, mechanisms
are the “underlying entities, processes, or [social] structures which operate in particular contexts to generate
the outcomes of interest” [35]. This combination of the
context (C), mechanisms (M), and outcome (O) in an
intervention is called a C-M-O configuration. Recurrent
patterns of C-M-O configurations are known as demiregularities, or semi-predictable pattern/pathway of how
a program functions. In other words, demi-regularities
are a broad rule for how and when certain outcomes
usually occur [28].
While full realist reviews can require a considerable
dedication of time to the exploration of literature and
subsequent analysis, rapid realist reviews (RRRs) have
been used to enable a quicker transition from research to policy and/or practice [36]. Given the need
for a timely synthesis and its application for the Picking Up the PACE programme, we undertook a rapid
realist review; which allows us to maintain the core
elements of the realist methodology and produce
timely data.

Prior to this rapid realist review, a pre-specified protocol was registered (PROSPERO registration number:
CRD42017064430) and published [37] which included
the research question, search strategy, synthesis methodology, preliminary program theory, definitions, inclusion
criteria for relevance screening, data extraction form,
quality assessment tool, and plans for dissemination. An
overview of the methods and any modifications to the
original protocol are described below. Utilizing the
RAMESES (Realist and Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards) [38], and adapting it to follow a
rapid realist review [34], the following steps were
applied:
Clarifying the scope
Identifying the research question

This rapid realist review supports a larger program,
Picking Up the PACE, that aims to increase the ability of
healthcare providers to offer evidence-based interventions to tobacco users which encompass changing modifiable risk behaviours (excess alcohol consumption,
physical inactivity, poor diet, stress, and poor sleep) to
ultimately achieve long-term smoking abstinence. As a
result, this review focuses on smoking cessation in the
context of multiple health behaviour change interventions that also address these other risk behaviours.
In order to clarify the scope of the rapid realist review,
a multidisciplinary team with expertise in knowledge
synthesis, public health, and multiple health behaviour
change met in-person on nine occasions for 1 h over the
course of 6 months. Our initial research question was:
“What factors are associated with effective multiple
health behaviour change (three or more behaviours including smoking)?”
Changes in the rapid realist review process

After a preliminary review of the data, further specificity
of the study question was required to meet the desired
outcome. The contexts and mechanisms involved in
changing multiple health behaviours might be different
than those involved in smoking cessation. Thus we
modified our research question to: “What contexts and
mechanisms are associated with improving smoking cessation outcome in interventions that target two or more
additional unhealthy behaviours.”
Initial theory

We identified our initial theory of how, when, and why
multiple health behaviour change interventions work by
reviewing seven large-scale multi-factorial cardiovascular
disease and cancer risk interventions [39–45]. These
studies included the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention
Trial (MRFIT) [39], the North Karelia Project [40], the
Stanford Five City Project [41], Project PREVENT [43],

Minian et al. BMC Public Health

(2020) 20:918

the Minnesota Heart Health Program [45], the Mediterranean Lifestyle Trial [44], and the BETTER Trial [42],
all of which are well-known studies that promoted multiple health behaviour change in large community samples [46]. As specified in our protocol manuscript [37],
our preliminary review of these seven interventions involved having two independent reviewers extract the following information from the studies:
1. The specific activities within each intervention.
Activities are physical/tangible tasks that were
undertaken by the intervention (e.g. counselling,
sharing of educational flyers, workshop, courses,
prize draw). Please note, we coded all activities
undertaken by intervention for any behaviour, not
only those related to smoking.
2. The setting in which the intervention took place,
including physical environment, social setting, and
political climate (if provided).
3. The outcomes of each intervention, including any
behavioural and/or clinical outcomes.
Through this preliminary review, we found that successful interventions usually had: pre-existing infrastructure that facilitates the delivery of the
intervention, and targeting regions (e.g. geographic,
population groups) where the need for the intervention is well-characterized. Furthermore, activities
undertaken by these interventions often targeted the
surrounding community and/or organizational structure. This multi-level approach appears to be in an
effort to change the physical and social opportunities
that can help facilitate multiple health behaviour
change in individuals. Individual-level activities frequently focused on increasing patient’s awareness and
knowledge, improving feelings of support, empowerment, and incorporating incentives for completing
activities.
Upon closer review, we realized that these activities
mapped onto the COM-B model; which stipulates that
behaviour change requires change in one or more of the
following component: capability, opportunity, and motivation [30]. All seven studies used in developing our
initial program theory sought to change at least one
component of this behavioural system. We used the taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [31] to code
each activity specified in the studies and we crossreferenced these codes with the COM-B model. We used
Table 2 in Michie and colleagues’ article to help us create the links between the components of the COM-B
model and the BCT taxonomy [30]. For example an
intervention that helped participants set a quit date was
categorized as BCT 1.3“Goal setting” and consequently
coded under “Capability” within the COM-B model. A

Page 4 of 26

visual depiction of this theory can be found in the published protocol [37].
The coded data was reviewed by our expert panel,
which had a total of 11 members and was comprised of
representatives from the Medical Psychiatry Alliance,
Public Health Ontario, and the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health. Over the course of 9 in-person meetings,
the expert panel assisted the research team with the review and development of the initial program theory.
Searching for relevant evidence: search strategy and
eligibility criteria

To test our program theory, a search strategy was developed and implemented to retrieve relevant primary data
from both academic and grey literature. The search
strategy was informed by the research team and developed by a medical librarian who executed the search
across multiple bibliographic databases [37]. After our
protocol was published, minor changes were made to
the search strategy (see Additional File 1). The initial
search aimed to identify as many multiple health behaviour interventions as possible, allowing the team to accurately identify trends across the literature.
To identify grey literature from Canada, Europe, and
the USA, variations of the phrase “multiple health behaviours” were used to hand search the websites and online repositories of international, national, and provincial
health organizations, health behaviour/condition-specific
associations, clinical trial registries, and grey literature
repositories. Reference lists of three systematic reviews
and meta-analyses [27, 106, 107] were also hand
searched to identify any relevant resources not captured
by the systematic searches. No additional articles were
included from the grey literature or reference list
searches. After the search was complete, we chose to exclude books and reviews. It should be noted that 22 interventions were identified as having more than one
publication reporting similar results. In these cases, the
lead scientist and two additional members of the team
selected one article per intervention to represent the
contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes of the intervention,
and excluded other articles associated with that
intervention.
Relevance confirmation, data extraction, and quality
assessment

Two independent reviewers assessed each study to determine its relevance to our research question, extract
pertinent information, and appraise its quality using predesigned and pre-tested relevance screening and data extraction forms [37]. The systematic review software DistillerSR [108] was used for this process. As described in
our protocol [37], to be included in this review the study
had to:

(excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity,

longer) smoking cessation outcomes





Since we had multiple study designs included in
this rapid realist review, a combination of the Mixed
Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) [109] and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) [110] was
used to evaluate the methodological quality of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies. Each
type of study was assessed by two reviewers using a
pre-designed quality assessment form [37]. As per
MMAT and CASP appraisal methods, the quality criteria differed based on the study design; quantitative
– randomized controlled trial (eight criteria), quantitative – non-randomized (10 criteria), qualitative (10
criteria), and mixed-method (six criteria). These criteria were scored using a nominal scale (Yes/No/Can’t
Tell).
Based on the scoring metrics of the MMAT [109] and
adjusting for the additional CASP criteria [110], an overall quality score was calculated for each study using the
descriptors *, **, ***, and ****. For all types of studies, the
score was derived by taking the number of criteria met
and dividing it by the number of criteria. Scores were
assigned the following descriptors: 0–25% (*), 26–50%
(**), 51–75% (***), and 76% + (****). To score the mixed
methods studies, the overall quality could not exceed the
quality of the weakest section of the study. For example,
in a mixed method study, if the qualitative score is (**),
and the quantitative and mixed method scores are both
(***), the study is assigned an overall score of the lowest
section (**).The questions used to score each study can
be found in Additional File 2.
Prior to data extraction and coding of the context,
mechanisms, and outcomes within the studies, reviewers
were trained on the COM-B model, the Behaviour
Change Wheel and the BCT taxonomy [30, 31]. They
were also trained on how to characterize the various
techniques that are used within interventions and map
these techniques onto the COM-B model. Once trained,
the following process was also undertaken by the two independent reviewers:
 Review article to identify and record the activities

that took place in the intervention.
 Code the modifiable risk behaviours the intervention

was targeting.
 Code which techniques were applied to each

activity, as defined by the BCT taxonomy. Please
note, we coded all activities and corresponding





techniques in the intervention, not only those that
are specific to smoking cessation.
Determine how each technique is associated with
the COM-B model.
Code the target population (e.g. gender, ethnicity,
general public vs patients)
Code the smoking outcome(s), including whether
there was a statistically significant change and the
follow-up period in which the outcome was assessed
(e.g. end of treatment, 6 months, 12 months, or 24
months)
Code the context where the intervention took place
(e.g. region, clinical setting, clinical, communitybased settings, and/or school-based settings)
At each step, discrepancies between two reviewers
were resolved by consensus or, when necessary, by a
third reviewer.

Data analysis and synthesis process

The data from DistillerSR [108] was exported to Microsoft Excel for descriptive analysis and analyzed using
NVivo 11 [111]. To determine whether the intervention
fit the initial program theory and to identify if there were
any emerging patterns in the types and combination of
C-M-O’s configurations used, the reviewers examined
the studies to see whether the interventions had also focused on changed physical and social opportunities and/
or other behaviour change techniques such as raising
awareness, increasing knowledge, and encouraging empowerment. The behaviour change techniques did not
have to be specific to smoking and could be targeting
any modifiable risk behaviours. For example, if a multiple health behaviour change intervention offered membership to a gym to help improve physical activity, this
was coded as Opportunity.
Smoking cessation outcomes were measured in a variety of ways across articles, including different time
points (e.g. at end of treatment, 3 months, 12 months),
duration of abstinence (e.g. 7-day point prevalence abstinence vs last 30 days), and presentation of data (e.g.
descriptive vs statistical analyses). These outcomes were
verified (e.g. biochemically) or were self-reported. The
literature shows that both types of outcomes are valid
[112–114] and therefore we did not differentiate between self-reported measures and biochemically verified
measures. However, studies that used non-validated
measures/screeners for self-report questions would be
penalized in the quality assessment score. Please see
Additional File 2 questions used to score each study.
As a result, we organized our findings by whether statistically significant smoking cessation outcomes were
observed and whether the outcome was measured longterm (i.e. ≥5 months). Within these outcome types, the
interventions were organized by the three categories that

Minian et al. BMC Public Health

(2020) 20:918

were then used to identify the mechanisms (capability,
opportunity, and motivation) and the context in which
the intervention occurred. Many of the reviewed articles
did not describe the context in which the intervention
was implemented in sufficient detail. Thus we decided
to be as broad as possible and divided context into three
categories: 1) the continent in which the intervention
took place, 2) the type of setting (e.g. clinical, workplace)
and 3) whether it was a multidisciplinary intervention.
We established the following criteria to report demiregularities:
 There were a minimum of three interventions using

the specific C-M-O configuration.
 Among interventions with a specific C-M-O config-

uration, either ≥60% OR ≤ 40% of these interventions
reported statistically significant increase in smoking
cessation.

To present an example of how this process works,
if we discover a C-M-O configuration (e.g. Clinical
Setting – Capability – Smoking Cessation Outcome)
within an intervention, there must be at least two
other interventions with this C-M-O configuration to
allow for further analysis. In this hypothetical example, if we have a total of ten interventions that
have ‘Clinical Setting-Capability-Smoking Cessation
Outcome’ configuration, we then have to determine
what percentage of these studies reported a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation. In
order for this C-M-O configuration to be categorized
as a demi-regularity, at least 60% of these interventions must report a statistically significant increase in
long-term smoking cessation outcome (i.e. ≥5
months). The demi-regularity in this case would be
that interventions in clinical settings that target capability are more likely to lead to improvement in
smoking cessation outcome. Alternatively, if ≤40% of
the interventions reported a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation outcome, the demiregularity would suggest that interventions in clinical
settings that target capability are less likely to lead to
improvements in smoking cessation outcomes.
In this paper, we analyzed demi-regularities in interventions that were rated four stars in our quality rating,
used statistical analyses, and reported long-term smoking cessation outcomes (i.e. ≥5 months). We chose to
only include those interventions with a four star rating
as they have the least amount of bias. Once a demiregularity was discovered, studies that had lower quality
assessment scores (less than four stars), and/or did not
perform statistical analyses were included in our pool
for analysis to confirm if the previously observed demiregularity persisted.

Results
The flow of information through the rapid realist review
process is shown in Fig. 1.
A descriptive overview of all the interventions is provided in Table 1. Table 2 outlines the contexts, activities,
and mechanisms used by interventions with statistically
significant long-term (i.e. ≥5 months) smoking cessation
outcomes.
Exploration of the differences and commonalities
among the interventions reveals several trends. For example, all interventions that took place in Africa (n = 2)
addressed only three behaviours and these behaviours
did not include alcohol, stress, or sleep. Furthermore,
none of the interventions in Africa use motivation as a
mechanism. There was only one multiple health behaviour change intervention that took place in Central/
South America (n = 1). This intervention was conducted
in a clinical setting and was designed to address four behaviours simultaneously. On the other hand, Europe
(n = 60) and North America (n = 49) had larger variations in the number and types of behaviours addressed
by any given intervention. Europe and North America
were the only continents in which sleep was also targeted within behavioural change interventions. North
America was also the only region in which there were
interventions that targeted all six modifiable risk behaviours simultaneously.
Overall, the majority of interventions employed at least
two mechanisms. Specifically 31(22%) interventions only
used one mechanism, 66 (48%) interventions used two
mechanisms, and 41 (30%) targeted all three mechanisms. As shown in Tables 1, 66 studies (48%) were
scored as 4 stars, 59 (43%) were three stars, and 13 (9%)
were scored as two stars. Common reasons why studies
scored less than four stars included: lack of clarity
around whether bias was sufficiently addressed, use of
non-validated measures, insufficient description of
randomization process (if applicable), and high withdrawal/drop-out.
Demi-regularity – opportunity

For the purposes of this rapid realist review, “opportunity” was defined as “all the factors that lie outside
the individual that make the behaviour possible or
prompt it” [30]. When interventions focused on increasing the “opportunity” to access services and
change the social environment, tobacco users who engaged in other unhealthy behaviours were more likely
to achieve long-term smoking cessation. In particular,
interventions that: 1) provided “access” to healthy living tools (e.g. free medications such as nicotine replacement therapy, gym memberships, walking
groups, free/accessible fruits and vegetables, etc.) and/
or 2) encouraged “social support” (e.g. incorporating

There were 32 interventions [40, 49, 51, 54–56, 61, 63,
65, 71, 75, 82, 83, 92, 95, 96, 101, 103, 105, 115–127]
that used opportunity as one of the mechanisms for behaviour change with the majority of these interventions
(59%) [40, 49, 51, 54–56, 61, 63, 65, 71, 75, 82, 83, 92,
95, 96, 101, 103, 105] reporting successful long-term cessation. There were 12 interventions that aimed to increase access to resources as a part of the intervention
[49, 56, 61, 63, 82, 83, 92, 95, 96, 103, 119, 121]. Of
these, 10 (83%) interventions reported successful longterm smoking cessation [49, 56, 61, 63, 82, 83, 92, 95,
96, 103]. The majority of interventions that made
changes to the physical and/or social environment (8/11;
73%) [40, 56, 61, 71, 83, 96, 103, 105] or interventions
that improved patient’s social support system (10/15;

67%) [51, 54, 55, 65, 75, 82, 96, 101, 103, 105] also reported successful long-term cessation.
In various settings (e.g. clinical settings, community
settings, workplace, etc.) and across several continents,
programs that aimed to increase the opportunity to
change behaviours were successful in achieving longterm smoking abstinence among their participants
(Table 3). These trends remain fairly consistent when
examining all interventions; including those interventions that were given a rating from one to three stars in
our quality assessment and reported statistical significance (see Additional File 3).
Demi-regularity – capability

For this review, capability was defined as the “individual’s psychological and physical capacity to engage in
healthy behaviours” [30]. The success of interventions
that included capability as a mechanism appears to be
dependent on various factors, including: the specific

context in which these interventions were implemented,
the populations that were targeted, and the types of behaviours targeted in the intervention. When examining
specific techniques for increasing capability, including
“capacity to plan”, “enhancing knowledge” and “empowerment”, the effectiveness of these techniques was
dependent on the context in which it was implemented.

Of the 53 interventions in our sample that were
based on this mechanism [12, 40, 43, 49, 51, 52, 54–
56, 61, 63, 65, 69, 71, 75, 81–83, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101,
103, 105, 115–142], only 23 (43%) interventions resulted in long-term smoking cessation [40, 49, 51, 52,
54–56, 61, 63, 65, 69, 71, 75, 81–83, 92, 95, 96, 98,
101, 103, 105]. Unlike the trends observed with opportunity, the majority of interventions that used capability as one of the mechanisms were not successful.
These trends persisted when we looked at specific
techniques for increasing capability. Only one [75] of
the four interventions [75, 123, 130, 131] that sought
to change to one’s beliefs about the intervention (a
technique used to increase capability) reported successful long-term smoking cessation.
However, there were certain contexts in which interventions based on this mechanism observed more success. Specifically, four [56, 65, 69, 75, 81] out of eight
interventions [56, 65, 69, 75, 81, 118, 122, 125] in Asia
reported that participants were more likely to quit smoking. Interventions that utilized capability in community
based settings or in schools also had positive results with
71% (5/7) [40, 61, 63, 81, 92] and 80% (4/5) [40, 56, 71,
83], respectively reporting long-term smoking cessation.
There was only one observable trend among interventions that used capability to target primary prevention or
secondary prevention. Interventions that targeted secondary prevention and aimed to empower participants
did not appear to be effective. Only two (40%) [65, 75]
of the five interventions [65, 75, 133, 135, 140] reported
successful long-term smoking cessation.
Conversely, there were certain contexts in which using
capability as a mechanism appeared to negatively impact
the success of the intervention. In Europe (6/19; 32%)
[40, 52, 54, 55, 92, 95] and in Australasia (2/5; 40%) [49,
101], only a minority of the interventions using capability reported participants were more likely to quit smoking. Even when we examined specific techniques for
increasing capability that were used in Europe, very few
interventions reported successful long-term smoking
cessation. Similar trends were observed with interventions that took place in clinical settings; only 37% (10/
27) [40, 52, 55, 61, 65, 69, 75, 81, 82, 95] of the interventions reported participants were more likely to quit
smoking.

The type and number of risk behaviours targeted by
interventions that aimed to increase patient’s capability
were also examined (Table 4). Unlike what was observed
for opportunity, using capability as a mechanism in an
intervention only appeared to be successful for certain
behaviours and when specific techniques for increasing
capability were used. For example, among interventions
that targeted stress, the majority of interventions (6/10;
60%) [40, 95, 96, 101, 103, 105] that used “capacity to
plan” demonstrated success in achieving long-term
smoking cessation. Furthermore, 60% (3/5) [75, 101,
103] of interventions that targeted alcohol and used ‘empowerment’ as a technique for increasing capability reported long-term smoking cessation. However, only 33%
(1/3) of interventions [75] that targeted alcohol and used
the technique of changing ‘beliefs about the intervention’
reported long-term smoking cessation.
Demi-regularity – motivation

Motivation, defined as “all those brain processes that
energize and direct behaviour, not just goals and conscious decision-making” [30], appears to be effective in
certain contexts for improving smoking cessation
outcomes.
Supporting evidence

Thirty seven interventions [12, 40, 43, 52, 55, 56, 58, 63,
69, 77, 82, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101, 103, 105, 115, 117, 118,
120, 123–125, 127, 130, 131, 133, 134, 136–138, 140–
143] in our sample utilized motivation as a mechanism.
However, based on our criteria, there were very few
techniques involving motivation that had any reportable
trends. As a result, we have chosen to provide a descriptive overview of these trends.
Interventions that aimed to increase participant’s motivation had mixed results, as 43% (16/37) [40, 52, 55,
56, 58, 63, 69, 77, 82, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101, 103, 105] of
studies reported an association between increasing participant’s motivation and long-term smoking cessation.
Similar to capability, implementing strategies that increased motivation within interventions appeared to be
beneficial in certain contexts. For example, the majority
of interventions that utilized motivation in communitybased settings (3/4; 75%) [40, 63, 92] and schools (2/3;
67%) [40, 56] reported that participants were more likely
to quit smoking long-term. In contrast, applying motivation as a mechanism was unsuccessful in clinical settings; eight (36%) [40, 52, 55, 58, 69, 77, 82, 95] of the 22
[12, 40, 43, 52, 55, 58, 69, 77, 82, 95, 117, 123–125, 127,
130, 133, 134, 136, 140, 141, 143] interventions in these
settings reported participants were more likely to quit
smoking.
In terms of the number of behaviours that were targeted, interventions targeting three behaviours

Page 15 of 26

demonstrated limited success; only six (32%) [52, 55, 56,
58, 63, 69] of the 19 interventions [12, 52, 55, 56, 58, 63,
69, 120, 123–125, 127, 133, 134, 136, 137, 140, 141, 143]
reported long-term smoking cessation. The types of behaviours targeted by these interventions were also examined. The majority of interventions that focused on
increasing patient’s motivation and targeted stress (8/12;
67%) [40, 92, 95, 96, 98, 101, 103, 105] reported a greater
likelihood of long-term smoking cessation.

Discussion
Health behaviour change programs that address multiple
behaviours have been the subject of much discussion because there are a multitude of ways in which these programs can be developed, including: the types and
numbers of modifiable risk behaviours to target [144],
the types of activities to use [30], and the types of professions to involve [145–147]. In the current literature,
there is a clear gap in the understanding of why some interventions have worked and others have not [46]. The
results of this rapid realist review represent the first step
in addressing this gap. Specifically, the goal of this paper
was to review published interventions targeting multiple
modifiable risk behaviours to uncover demi-regularities
that contribute to the success of the program in helping
people quit smoking. In other words, what contexts and
mechanisms (i.e. structures, activities or processes within
interventions that contribute to the outcomes of interest) lead to long-term smoking cessation.
The results of this rapid realist review emphasize the
importance of incorporating mechanisms that modify
external factors in multiple health behaviour interventions that attempt to achieve long-term smoking cessation. Specifically, interventions that made resources (e.g.
pharmacotherapy, exercise, healthy foods) more accessible, changed the physical environment (e.g. introduced
smoke free polices), or increased one’s social support
network, were more likely to help individuals quit smoking. Evidence to support these findings were noticeable
across different regions, settings, and behaviours. These
findings challenge individualistic epidemiology that
many health promotion interventions are based on,
namely that health behaviours are a matter of individual
choice [148]. While individuals do have ‘free choice’, research shows that the environment can significantly influence the decisions they make [149–151].
The findings from this rapid realist review also show
that the success of interventions targeting motivation
and capability appears to be dependent on the context.
For example, interventions in Asia that tried to increase
capability were usually successful in helping people quit
smoking, while European interventions were not. The
literature shows that while smoking is no longer socially
acceptable in North America and Europe [152, 153], for

many countries in Asia (e.g. China), smoking continues
to be an accepted social activity [154, 155]. Thus, it
could be hypothesized that interventions that increase
person’s psychological capabilities (such as enhancing
knowledge and skills) are more successful in contexts
where the social climate was favourable to smoking. This
finding is similar to previous research, which shows that
the impact of knowledge on promoting successful behaviour change is dependent on the context in which it is
provided [156, 157].
With regards to the trends we have observed with interventions that target motivation, the majority of these
interventions did not appear to be successful in clinical
settings but were successful in schools and communitybased settings. A possible explanation for this is interventions delivered in non-clinic settings are reaching
populations that are not motivated as they are not currently seeking out health care. Populations that are
already in health care settings or seeking health care are
likely to be intrinsically motivated to make changes to
their behaviours [24, 158–163]. Thus, it is likely only in
settings where motivation is low that having programs
focusing on increasing motivation made a difference.
Significant strides have been made in the field of
tobacco control to reduce the prevalence of smoking
globally [164–166]. Tobacco control efforts have focused on changing the environment and the opportunities available to individuals (e.g. legislation
introducing smoke-free places, warning-labels on tobacco products) [164–166], which coincides with the
demi-regularities we have found in our review. However, for many other modifiable risk behaviours including alcohol and physical inactivity, public health
promotion has traditionally relied on education, information, and psychosocial interventions to persuade
individuals to adopt healthy lifestyles [167, 168].
Moreover, many widely used theories for behaviour
change, including the Theory of Reasoned Action,
Theory of Planned Behaviour, and the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change have focused
primarily on the individual [169–171]. These theories
do not account for the influence of environmental
factors and thus may further contribute to the individualistic approach in addressing these modifiable
risk behaviours. While some studies (n = 52 [38%]) in
this review report using an established theory (e.g.
Trans-theoretical Model of Behaviour Change), the
majority did not report whether they used a theoretical framework (n = 86 [62%]). Thus we were unable
to examine how the application of these theoretical
frameworks within the interventions may have influenced the results of this study. In the current population of smokers, who engage in additional modifiable
risk behaviours, this review shows that it is important

Page 18 of 26

for interventions to focus on changing an individual’s
opportunity to adopt additional healthy behaviours.
Applying the COM-B model

Using the COM-B model as our framework to categorize
the mechanisms provided a systematic and standardized
method to code the diverse interventions [172, 173].
This method is aligned with other reviews examining effective behaviour change interventions [174, 175]. It also
allowed us to use clearly-defined techniques that maps
on to the COM-B model, and a behaviour change taxonomy; thereby ensuring transparency and enabling replication [30, 31]. Focusing our analysis of mechanisms
using the COM-B model also allowed for documentation
of internal and external drivers of behaviour change,
something many other theories do not allow [169–171].
In addition, we were able to develop a high level of understanding of the general trends that influence whether
a program that targets multiple health behaviors is effective to help people quit smoking. Therefore, using the
COM-B model provided the first step in understanding
the determinants of successful behaviour change. While
the COM-B model has been criticized for ignoring contextual characteristics [176], this argument cannot be
made for this rapid realist review as we also analyzed
context as part of the C-M-O configuration. The COMB model was used only to code the mechanisms and we
subsequently examined the contexts which these mechanisms were operationalized.
There were some limitations to using the COM-B
model as the framework for the mechanisms in the CM-O configuration. As mentioned by other researchers
[176], this model in its current form does not provide
specific and tangible actions to incorporate into the design of an intervention. However, the COM-B model can
be mapped onto the Behaviour Change Wheel [30],
which provide specific recommendations for intervention designs that can be used to address each component of the COM-B. Thus, findings from this study are
not intended to be final; rather they offer guidance on
the next steps in generating hypotheses for future intervention studies. The COM-B model provides directions
on the mechanisms and consequently, the areas of the
Behaviour Change Wheel that should be explored
further.
Also important to note is that Michie’s group is currently developing and mapping Mechanisms of Action
(MoA) to behaviour change techniques [177]. MoAs are
defined as “the process through which behaviour change
occurs” [177]. In the future, it might become useful to
apply the findings of this review to the MoA. Carey
et al.’s study [178], which was published after we had
started coding our work, has hypothesised some possible
links between BCTs and MoA. The MoAs expressed in

Carey et al. are more granular than the ones we used in
this study. However, since it is based on the Behaviour
Change Technique Taxonomy we should be able to
draw comparisons. For example, some of the common
MoAs identified by Carey et al. include: knowledge,
skills, behavioural regulations, attitudes towards the behaviour, beliefs about capability, and beliefs about consequences. These are all characteristics we identified and
coded in each study and then grouped as “Capability”
using the COM-B model’s definition.
Limitations

A major limitation of this review is that many of the articles reviewed did not describe the context or the behavioural change techniques used in detail. For example,
we were unable to determine whether the setting in
which an intervention took place already had other resources and supports that contributed to the success of
the intervention (e.g. highly experienced staff). As a result, the contexts we were able to examine were broad,
including: the continent in which the intervention took
place and the type of setting (e.g. clinical, workplace).
Given the wide variety in the types of populations that
interventions targeted, we were not able to examine
trends by target population.
Moreover, in some instances, the studies did not provide sufficient details on the types of activities undertaken as a part of the intervention. This under-reporting
of active ingredients was recently discussed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of smoking cessation interventions [172, 173, 179]. Bruin et al. (2019) described
the challenge of reporting all the BCTs in a complex
intervention as they can include 20 or more BCTs [179].
It has been shown that even a routine visit between patients and health care professionals can include 15 or
more BCTs [180–182].
It is important to also acknowledge that there were
several challenges associated with isolating the mechanisms (i.e. capability, opportunity, motivation) within the
interventions. Specifically, it was often difficult to determine which mechanisms were targeted in studies that
provided insufficient information on study design, and/
or implementation. To get around this challenge, we
reviewed articles with four star quality ratings first to determine the demi-regularities. However, these limitations
also meant that, in some situations, we were unable to
identify whether a specific mechanism was used. This
may further contribute to the under-reporting of the
mechanisms targeted within the interventions.
Lastly, the majority of interventions in this review targeted at least two mechanisms simultaneously (n = 97,
70%). It is unclear the degree of overlap between mechanisms and how these mechanisms interact to produce
the observed outcome in these interventions. As a result,

Page 21 of 26

there may have been additional mechanisms and techniques that were employed by these interventions that
we were unable to capture in our analyses. Future areas
of research should also include examining the order in
which behaviours should be addressed, (simultaneously
vs sequential), the combination of behaviours to target,
and the combination of mechanisms to target.

Conclusion
Our study is the first to apply a realist review methodology to explore how, why and under what circumstances programs that target multiple risk behaviours are
associated with long-term smoking cessation. It offers an
explanatory view of the existing and extensive body of
literature on interventions targeting multiple health behaviours. The evidence we reviewed came from a variety
of countries, continents, settings, and targeted different
behaviours, and yet we were able to observe clear and
consistent themes regarding the importance of increasing an individual’s opportunity in multiple health behaviour change interventions. With regards to Picking Up
the PACE, the results of this rapid realist review informed the development of courses for practitioners on
how to support individuals who have multiple risk behaviours and are trying to quit smoking. Moving forward, programs that aim to address multiple modifiable
risk behaviours as a part of a smoking cessation intervention should strongly consider incorporating activities
that target external factors (i.e. social support, and access
to treatment). The findings of the review highlight the
value and importance of the COM-B model for effective
behaviour change. We recommend that decision-makers,
policy makers and implementers who are aiming to design multiple health behaviour change interventions
should consistently apply the COM-B model, take context into consideration, and wherever feasible, include
activities that improve an individual’s opportunities to
make successful behaviour change.

Capability, opportunity, and motivation: an
across contexts empirical examination of
the COM-B model
Taylor Jade Willmott* , Bo Pang and Sharyn Rundle-Thiele

Abstract
Background: There is limited evidence for successful weight gain prevention interventions targeting young adults.
Developing effective interventions necessitates a theoretical model that can identify barriers and enablers for
healthy eating and physical activity among young adults to support weight management. This study empirically
examines the utility of the COM-B model as a framework for intervention planning across two behavioural contexts:
eating and physical activity.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey research design was employed to empirically test the COM-B model in the
contexts of young adult’s eating and physical activity behaviours. Informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework,
pre-validated measures appropriate for capturing the latency of the COM (Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation)
constructs were sourced. Both surveys (eating and physical activity) were administered online to two independent
samples of young adults aged 18–35 years. Models were specified and tested using structural equation modelling.
Results: A total of 582 (mean age = 22.8 years; 80.3% female) and 455 (mean age = 24.9 years; 80.8% female)
participants were included in the physical activity and eating analyses, respectively. The COM-B model explained
31% of variance in physical activity behaviour and 23% of variance in eating behaviour. In the physical activity
model (N = 582), capability and opportunity were found to be associated with behaviour through the mediating
effect of motivation. In the eating model (N = 455), capability was found to be associated with behaviour through
the mediating effect of motivation. Capability was also found to mediate the association between opportunity and
motivation. Consistencies and variations were observed across both models in terms of COM indicators.
Conclusions: Findings support the COM-B model’s explanatory potential in the context of young adult’s physical
activity and eating behaviours. Barriers and enablers underlying young adult’s physical activity and eating
behaviours were identified that represent potential targets for future intervention design. Further research is
needed to validate present study findings across different populations and settings.

Background
The most rapid weight gain in the life course has been
observed during the early twenties to mid-thirties [1, 2],
with incident obesity at a younger age associated with
increased risk of chronic disease and mortality in later
adult life [2–4]. The causes of age-related weight gain
are complex, encompassing a range of individual, social,
and environmental factors that are often interrelated and
interdependent. Young adulthood, defined by the age
range of 18–35 years [5], is a transitional life stage in
which young people encounter significant life changes,
experience increasing independence, and adopt lasting
behavioural patterns [6]. Adoption of unhealthful behaviours, including marked declines in physical activity [7–
9], increases in sedentary behaviour [10, 11], and poor
dietary habits [8, 12–16], during young adulthood has
been associated with weight gain over time [17–19]. A
longitudinal cohort study of 640 adolescents observed a
24% decrease in physical activity over a 12-year transition from adolescence to early adulthood [9]. Similarly, a
cohort study of 773 young adults found 61.4% of young
adult’s waking wear time to be spent sedentary [11]. A
global analysis from 187 countries found young adults
have the lowest diet quality compared with any other
age group [16]. The adoption of unhealthful behavioural
patterns during young adulthood are attributed to the
significant life changes that occur during this transitional
period such as moving out of the family home, relocating to new environments, beginning full-time work or
further study, and establishing financial, residential, and
employment stability [6]. In particular, the transition to
higher education has been linked to weight gain and undesirable changes in health behaviours among young
adults [20]. A prospective study of 291 young adults who
were followed from their final year of high school until
their second year of university (college) found that students gained, on average, 2.7 kg during this transitional
period [20]. Lower sport participation rates, higher internet use, and lower studying rates were associated with
greater weight gain [20]. Moreover, low levels of physical
activity and poor dietary habits have been observed
among university students in health-related disciplines
where one may expect them to model healthful behavioural patterns [21]. Importantly, the adoption of healthful behaviours including regular physical activity and
consumption of nutrient-rich foods in young adulthood
has been associated with weight maintenance and a
lower risk of developing chronic disease in later adult life
[22]. Therefore, the establishment and maintenance of
healthful behavioural patterns during this transitional life
stage is critical to preventing weight gain and associated
chronic disease risk.
Recent reviews have highlighted the limited evidence
base for successful weight management (i.e., prevention

Page 2 of 17

of weight gain) interventions targeting young adults
[23–31], with large heterogeneity in intervention design
and outcomes observed [25, 27–29, 31]. Young adulthood is a developmentally unique life stage [6]. Consequently, interventions aimed at this demographic must
address the factors known to contribute to weight gain
during this transitional period [6] and work to remove
the perceived and actual barriers to adopting more
healthful behavioural patterns [32]. For young adults,
barriers to weight management often exceed enablers
[32], with healthful eating and physical activity not considered high priorities [33]. Young adults are typically
less concerned with their future health and wellbeing,
and as a result, engage in more risky health behaviours
[34]. Perceived time constraints, busy schedules, work
demands, lack of discipline, inadequate self-regulation
skills, and a lack of environmental support for healthful
eating and physical activity have been cited as barriers to
weight management [32, 33, 35–37]. Similarly, enablers
to weight management include knowledge and awareness, self-regulation skills, self-efficacy, and social and
environmental support [32, 33, 36, 38]. Comprehensive
empirical investigations of the relative importance of individual, social, and environmental barriers and enablers
among young adults are lacking. Further research is
needed to inform the systematic development of weight
gain prevention interventions that can be implemented
to effectively promote the adoption and maintenance of
healthful behavioural patterns in young adults by removing identified barriers and promoting enablers.
Understanding health behaviours, and the settings in
which they occur, is requisite for the design of effective
and efficient behavioural interventions [39, 40]. Building
an evidence base that can be reliably drawn upon to deliver beneficial change across different behaviours, populations, and contexts relies on the rigorous application
and reporting of theory by researchers and practitioners
in the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions [41]. Findings from a recent systematic review
[30] of reported theory use in weight management intervention targeting young adults revealed a majority of interventions do not rigorously apply theory. While many
studies made mention of theory, few integrated the referenced theory (or theories) throughout all intervention
stages. Of note, the lack of studies explicitly linking theoretical constructs to target behaviours in intervention
design [42] limits understanding of which constructs
elicit (or not) the desired change in young adult’s
weight-related behaviours [43] and their associated outcomes. In addition, review findings revealed only a small
number of theories had been applied in intervention design, namely Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [44], Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [45], and the Theory of
Reasoned Action/Planned Behaviour (TRA/TPB) [46, 47].

Willmott et al. BMC Public Health

(2021) 21:1014

Although there is evidence to support the explanatory
and/or predictive capacity of these predominantly
individual-focused social psychological theories (e.g.
TRA/TPB), albeit with varying degrees of success [48,
49], an over-reliance on the most popular theories
without direct empirical tests or questioning of
underlying assumptions limits progress in the field
[50–52].
Many popular theories of behaviour focus on the
intra-individual, and occasionally interpersonal factors,
of behaviour while failing to account for the complex
social and physical environments in which behaviour
occurs [40]. Moreover, many popular theories of behaviour (e.g. TRA/TPB) focus on the rational drivers
of individual behaviour and ignore the important
roles of automaticity, impulsivity, habit, self-control,
associative learning, and emotional processing [53].
Weight-related behaviours are determined by a complex interplay between individual, social, and environmental factors; therefore, theories selected to inform
intervention design in this context must provide a
systematic means of understanding behaviour and be
capable of capturing the full range of potential levers
of change [40].
Taken together, the small number of mainly
individual-focused social psychological theories being
applied in this context, coupled with a general lack
of rigorous theory application, is likely to be limiting
the effectiveness of weight gain prevention interventions targeting young adults. The purpose of this
study is to systematically identify enablers and barriers for two weight-related behaviours (eating and
physical activity) among young adults using the
COM-B model [54].

Fig. 1 The COM-B model

Page 3 of 17

Theoretical framework

The COM-B model [54] conceptualises behaviour as
part of a system of interacting factors. According to the
COM-B model, for a given behaviour to occur, at a given
moment, one must have the capability and opportunity
to engage in the behaviour, and the strength of motivation to engage in the behaviour must be greater than
for any other competing behaviour [40]. As illustrated in
Fig. 1, capability, opportunity, and motivation interact to
generate behaviour that may, in turn, affect these
factors.
Capability is defined as an individual’s psychological
and physical capacity to engage in the behaviour concerned. Physical capability relates to whether an individual possesses the necessary knowledge and skills
required to perform the target behaviour. Psychological
capability refers to an individual’s capacity to engage in
the necessary thought processes, comprehension, and
reasoning to perform the target behaviour [54]. Research
has shown capability to be associated with motivation
and behaviour in a range of contexts [55–60]. In the
COM-B model, capability is said to be associated with
behaviour directly and indirectly via the mediating effect
of motivation (see Fig. 1).
Opportunity is defined as all the external factors that
lie outside an individual that make behaviour possible or
prompt it, including physical and social factors [54].
Physical opportunity is afforded by the built environment and social opportunity is afforded by the cultural
milieu that dictates the way that individuals think about
things [54]. Past research suggests the role of opportunity in directly influencing behaviour is variable. Some
studies have shown opportunity to be associated with
behaviour [56, 58, 60]; whereas, other studies have

Willmott et al. BMC Public Health

(2021) 21:1014

reported no correlation between opportunity and behaviour [55, 57]. Of note, research has found that if both
the social and physical environment are supportive of
healthful eating and physical activity individuals will be
more likely to engage in these behaviours [61]. Moreover, a prospective cohort study by Howlett et al. [59]
found (social) opportunity to have an indirect association with physical activity via the mediating effect of
motivation in an adult sample. An additional study by
Howlett et al. [58] found opportunity to directly predict
motivation and sitting behaviour. In the COM-B model,
opportunity is said to be associated with behaviour directly and indirectly via the mediating effect of motivation (see Fig. 1).
Motivation is defined as all the brain processes that
energise and direct behaviour, not just goals and conscious decision-making [54]. A distinction is made between reflective motivational processes (evaluations and
plans) and automatic motivational processes (emotions
and impulses) [54]. Past research has shown motivation
to be associated with behaviour in a range of contexts
[55–57, 59, 60, 62]. Of note, Moorman and Matulich
[62] found motivation to be independently correlated
with preventive health behaviours. Similarly, Howlett
et al. [59] found motivation to be directly associated with
physical activity behaviour in adults and partially mediate associations between capability, opportunity, and behaviour. In contrast, Howlett et al. [58] found no direct
association between motivation and sitting behaviour. In
the COM-B model, motivation is said to be directly associated with behaviour and is proposed to mediate the
associations between capability, opportunity, and behaviour (see Fig. 1).
Behaviour is defined as any action a person takes in response to internal or external events [39]. Actions may
be overt and directly measurable or covert and indirectly
measurable [39]. In line with Australia’s Physical Activity
& Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Adults (18–64
years), young adults should be active on most, preferably
all, days of the week, accumulating 150 to 300 min (2.5
to 5 h) of moderate intensity activity or 75 to 150 min
(1.25 to 2.5 h) of vigorous intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week [63]. In addition,
they should complete muscle strengthening activities on
at least 2 days each week. In terms of sedentary behaviour, young adults should minimise the amount of time
spent in prolonged sitting and break up long periods of
sitting as often as possible. According to Australian
Dietary guidelines, young adults should consume fruit
and vegetables, legumes, wholegrains, reduced fat milk,
yoghurt, and cheese varieties, lean meats and poultry,
fish, eggs, nuts, and seeds for a nutrient-rich diet, and
drink water instead of sugar sweetened beverages and alcoholic drinks [64].

Behavioural interventions targeting weight management in young adults are often complex encompassing
multiple components (e.g., behavioural change techniques and technologies) and targeting multiple behaviours [29, 30] that interact together to effect weight
status as measured by body mass index (BMI). Physical
inactivity and unhealthy dietary habits (i.e., consumption
of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods) are two behaviours
most associated with weight status [18, 22, 65] and are
modifiable risk factors of chronic disease [66]. Weight
management is defined as the prevention of weight gain
through the maintenance of a healthy body weight or
the reversal of small gains to maintain a healthy body
weight [67]. Even small changes in physical activity and
dietary patterns can contribute to weight management
owing to desired shifts in energy balance (e.g., energy expenditure is equal, or greater than, energy intake). For
example, research suggests that small changes in behaviour that amount to a decrease in calorie intake of only
100 cal per day can effectively prevent weight gain [68].
Randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions have reported moderate success in changing
weight-related behaviours in prevention trials [23, 25,
69] and clinically significant reductions in overweight
and obesity [70, 71]. Identifying and understanding the
active ingredients within behavioural interventions is key
to achieving desired outcomes.
In the present study, we operationalise and test the
COM-B model to examine the role of capability, opportunity, and motivation in young adult’s eating and physical activity behaviours. We hypothesise that capability,
opportunity, and motivation will be associated with
young adult’s physical activity and eating behaviours. In
addition, we hypothesise that capability and opportunity
will be indirectly associated with behaviour via the mediating effect of motivation. Lastly, we hypothesise that
capability, opportunity, and motivation will explain
young adult’s physical activity and eating behaviours.

Methods
Procedure

The research protocol for this study was approved by
the Human Research Ethics Committee at the principal
investigator’s institution before study commencement
(ref no. 2017/308). A cross-sectional survey research design was employed to empirically test the COM-B model
in the contexts of young adult’s eating and physical activity behaviours. Both surveys (physical activity and eating) were developed and administered online using
LimeSurvey. The physical activity survey was disseminated in April 2018 and the eating survey was disseminated in October 2018. The landing page of both
surveys included the purpose of the research, approximate duration of the survey, incentive for participation,

Willmott et al. BMC Public Health

(2021) 21:1014

notification of the voluntary nature of participation, and
a link to the full information sheet. By clicking continue,
participants consented to their participation. Respondents who completed the survey in its entirety were
given the option to enter a random draw to win one of
10 $50 gift vouchers. The use of a prize draw as an incentive for participation was outlined in the approved
research protocol. Participation in the study was entirely
voluntary and participants could withdraw from the
study at any point without repercussions. Research supports the use of incentives (e.g., random prize draw) [72,
73] and there is no conclusive evidence to suggest the
use of incentives results in coercion [74]. To further optimise survey response rates and reduce respondent burden, a staggered delivery (see dissemination timeline
above) was employed. Participants who completed the
physical activity survey and agreed to be contacted for
future research were sent invitations to participate in the
eating survey. In accordance with best practice, reminder
messages were sent to participants to complete the eating survey [75].
Participants

The target population of interest for this study was Australian adults aged 18–35 years. A combination of convenience, purposive, and snowball sampling methods
was used to recruit eligible participants. The use of multiple sampling techniques was expected to increase survey response rates [76]. In Australia, 88% of university
students (including associate, undergraduate, and postgraduate degrees) fall within the 18–35-year age range
[77]. Student and staff broadcast emails were used to recruit eligible participants from six large Australian universities. Snowball sampling was also initiated by
encouraging respondents who completed the survey to
share the survey link via their social networks. Participants were screened for eligibility (via nationality and
date of birth) prior to inclusion.
Measures

Pre-validated measures (indicators) appropriate for capturing the latency of COM constructs in the contexts of
physical activity and eating were sourced from the literature to create two survey instruments. Measures were
informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)
[78], with domains mapped onto COM constructs (see
Additional File 1). This method has been applied in previous research [58, 59]. Where possible, the same measures were used in both surveys, with minor adaptions
made to item wording to match behavioural context.
Both survey instruments were developed for specific use
in this study (see Additional File 2). For instances where
measures could not be adapted (e.g., environmental context and resources), a further literature search was

Page 5 of 17

performed to source contextually appropriate measures.
A total of 17 pre-validated measurement scales were obtained. The physical activity survey consisted of 137
items and the eating survey consisted of 120 items. Fiveand seven-point scales (unipolar, bipolar, and semantic
differential) were used.
In terms of outcome measures, physical activity was
measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) scale [79]. The 9-item
IPAQ-SF is a widely accepted measure of self-reported
physical activity that has been shown to be reliable and
valid [79, 80]. The IPAQ-SF records activity across four
levels: 1) vigorous-intensity activity, 2) moderateintensity activity, 3) walking, and 4) sitting. A metabolic
equivalent of task (MET) score is calculated for each activity type by weighting its energy requirements: 3.3
METs for walking, 4 METs for moderate-intensity activity, and 8 METs for vigorous-intensity activity. A total
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) MET
score is calculated from the sum of MET-minutes/week
score for each level. Participants may overestimate their
self-reported physical activity when compared to objective measures [81]; a common limitation of subjective
measures. A 7-day recall of activity levels was used in
the current study to reduce respondent burden [79]. Diet
was measured using 12 items derived from a previously
validated measurement instrument that assesses food
group consumption frequency in line with the Dietary
Guidelines for Australian Adults [82–84]. Each item is
scored from 0 to 10 to reflect compliance with dietary
guidelines for that specific food group [64] and then
summed to create a total score ranging from 0 to 120
(higher scores indicate better diet quality).
To capture sample characteristics, several sociodemographic questions were asked at the end of the
survey. Socio-demographic variables included: age,
sex, education, employment, income, relationship status, and ethnicity. Socio-demographic variables were

only
(see
Additional File 3).
Analysis

Descriptive statistics were analysed using SPSS v25. Exploratory factor analyses were performed in SPSS to ascertain the underlying structure of the measures selected
to capture the latent COM constructs. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in AMOS v25. Anderson
and Gerbing’s [85] two-step approach to structural equation modelling was then followed. Both measurement
and structural models were specified and tested in
AMOS v25 using maximum likelihood estimation. A
final structural model was established through a stepwise
process of model trimming: (i) removing statistically
non-significant (p > .05) indicators; and (ii) removing

indicators with low squared multiple correlations
(SMC < .3). Several goodness-of-fit indices were used to
determine model acceptability (see Table 1).

Results
Sample characteristics
Physical activity survey

The physical activity survey received a total of 1104 initial responses, 275 of which were deemed to be nonresponses (< 1 measure completed). A further 247 responses were deleted owing to significant item nonresponse, leaving a total usable sample of 582 cases.
Cases with a significant percentage (missing rate > 10%)
of item nonresponse were removed as statistical analysis
is likely to be biased when more than 10% of data are
missing [89]. The mean age of participants in the sample
was 22.8 years (SD = 4.87), with a large proportion being
Caucasian (82.5%), female (80.3%), full-time university
students (57.7%) earning $75,000 or less a year (77.9%).
The mean BMI among participants was 20.30 (SD =
4.60). See Additional File 3 for sample characteristics.
Eating survey

The eating survey received a total of 805 initial responses, 234 of which were deemed to be non-responses
(< 1 measure completed). A further 116 responses were
deleted owing to significant item non-response [89],
leaving a total usable sample of 455 cases. The mean age
of participants in the sample was 24.9 years (SD = 5.15),
with a large proportion being Caucasian (72.5%), female
(80.8%), full-time university students (52.2%) earning
$75,000 or less a year (59.3%). The mean BMI among
participants was 24.21 (SD = 5.65). See Additional File 3
for sample characteristics.

being physically active (vigorous, moderate, and walking)
during a given week was 152.48 (SD = 91.91). Average
time (total in minutes) spent engaging in MVPA was
90.79 (SD = 71.46). The mean diet quality score was
78.03 (SD = 15.13). Levels of physical activity and dietary
quality scores reflect broader trends observed among
young adults [9, 11, 16], and in particular, university students [8].
Descriptive statistics

Following reliability analyses, composite measures were
created as a sum of the total divided by the number of
items in the measurement scale [90]. Table 2 presents
the descriptive statistics of all composite measures
created.
Scale reliability and validity

All measurement scales had acceptable item-total correlations (> .30). All measurement scales had Cronbach’s
Alpha (α) values > .70 [90], with the exception of descriptive norms (see Table 3). Convergent validity was
evaluated using standardised regression weights: loadings
that were significant and greater than 0.5 (ideally > .70)
were considered valid. These findings were confirmed by
examining the average variances extracted (> .50) [91].
Discriminant validity was assumed if average variance
extracted estimates were greater than the squared correlation estimates [91], see Table 4. Composite reliability
was calculated as an additional measure of the shared
variance among the observed variables (i.e., indicators of
latent COM constructs) with a threshold of > .70 used
[91], refer to Table 4.

As shown in Table 5 (and Fig. 2), variance explained
in physical activity behaviour (as measured via IPAQ-SF
scores) was 31%. Motivation was positively associated
with physical activity behaviour (β = .71, p < .001). This
means the higher young adult’s motivation is to be physically active, the higher their level of physical activity.
Equally, the lower young adult’s motivation is to be
physically active, the lower their level of physical activity.
The four statistically significant indicators of motivation
were identity (β = .90, p < .001), positive affect (β = .77,
p < .001), self-efficacy (β = .74, p < .001), and intentions
(β = .69, p < .001). All four indicators had a positive association with motivation to be physically active.
Capability was positively associated with physical activity behaviour via the mediating effect of motivation (β =
.91, p < .001). Consequently, the more capable young
adults are (or feel they are) in being physically active, the
more motivated they will be to engage in physical activity, thereby resulting in higher levels of physical activity.
Similarly, the less capable young adults are (or feel they
are) in being physically active, the less motivated they
will be to engage in physical activity, thereby resulting in
lower levels of physical activity. The three statistically

significant indictors of capability were habits (β = .86,
p < .001), action control (β = .84, p < .001), and action
planning (β = .74, p < .001). All three indicators had a
positive association with capability to be physically
active.
Opportunity was positively associated with physical activity behaviour via the mediating effect of motivation
(β = .11, p < .001). Thus, an environment conducive to
physical activity increases motivation to be physically active, and in turn, results in higher levels of physical activity. In contrast, an environment that does not support
physical activity decreases motivation to engage in physical activity, and in turn, results in lower levels of physical activity. The two statistically significant indicators of
opportunity were social support (β = .82, p < .001) and
subjective norms (β = .68, p < .001). Both indicators had
a positive association with opportunity to be physically
active.
Specification of the eating structural path model
followed the same process as the physical activity model.
Following measurement model validation, a structural
path model was specified and tested. Stepwise theoretically supported adjustments were made to the structural
model according to modification indices. Of note, the
direct paths between capability and behaviour, and opportunity and behaviour, were removed. Only indirect
associations via motivation remained in the final structural model. In addition, opportunity was found to be associated with motivation via the mediating effect of

capability. The direct path between opportunity and motivation was subsequently removed. The final eating
structural model demonstrated acceptable fit with sample data (CMIN/DF = 2.061; GFI = .968, AGFI = .940;
CFI = .981; TLI = 0.970; RMSEA = 0.048; SRMR = .030).

Fig. 3 Eating structural model

The results of the final eating structural model are reported in Table 6 and visually depicted in Fig. 3.
As shown in Table 6 (and Fig. 3), variance explained
in eating behaviour (as measured via diet quality score)
was 23%. Motivation was positively associated with eating behaviour (β = .48, p < .001). Thus, the more motivated young adults are to eat healthily, the higher their
diet quality will be. Conversely, the less motivated young
adults are to eat healthily, the lower their diet quality
will be. The six statistically significant indicators of motivation were self-efficacy (β = .89, p < .001), identity (β =
.82, p < .001), affective attitudes (β = .73, p < .001),
intention (β = .72, p < .001), perceived behavioural control (β = .55, p < .001), and instrumental attitudes (β =
.46, p < .001). All six indicators were positively associated
with motivation to eat healthily.
Capability was positively associated with eating behaviour via the mediating effect of motivation (β = .95,
p < .001). Thus, the more capable young adults are (or
believe they are) in eating healthily, the more motivated
they will be to consume nutrient-rich foods, and in turn,
the higher their diet quality will be. Conversely, the less
capable young adults are (or believe they are) in eating
healthily, the less motivated they will be to consume

nutrient-rich foods, and in turn, the lower their diet
quality will be. The three statistically significant indictors
of capability were habits (β = .86, p < .001), decision making cons (β = −.69, p < .001), and action control (β = .59,
p < .001). Habits and action control were positively associated with capability to eat healthily, whereas decision
making (cons) was negatively associated with capability
to eat healthily.
Opportunity was positively associated with motivation
via the mediating effect of capability (β = .82, p < .001).
This means the more conducive an environment is
to healthy eating, the more capable young adults are (or
feel they are), and in turn, the more motivated they are
to eat healthily. The three statistically significant indictors of opportunity were home environment (β = .82,
p < .001), descriptive norms (β = .43, p < .001), and shop
environment (β = .43, p < .001). All three indicators had
a positive association with opportunity to eat healthily.

Discussion
Main findings

The purpose of this study was to systematically identify
enablers and barriers for eating and physical activity behaviours among young adults using the COM-B model

Willmott et al. BMC Public Health

(2021) 21:1014

[57]. Findings revealed the COM-B model’s explanatory
potential to vary across behavioural contexts (R2 = 0.31
for physical activity and R2 = 0.23 for eating). The variance explained by both models compares favourably to
that of other social psychological theories [49, 92–94].
Variance explained has been reported to be between 14
and 24% for the TPB [49]. Conversely, a review summarising multiple social psychological theories (TPB, SCT,
SDT, HPM, and TTM) reported explained variance in
adolescent’s physical activity behaviours to range from
24 to 35% [94], indicating that the COM-B model, as
measured and tested in the present study, can offer an
alternate theoretical perspective (socio-ecological)
explaining between 23 and 31% of young adult’s eating
and physical activity behaviours. In practical terms, the
COM-B model can identify individual, social, and environmental factors enabling and/or preventing healthy eating and physical activity in young adults.
In the physical activity model, capability and opportunity were found to be positively associated with physical activity behaviour through the mediating effect of
motivation. In the eating model, capability was found to
be associated with behaviour through the mediating effect of motivation, with capability mediating the association between opportunity and motivation. Previous
research has reported similar interactions with motivation mediating the effect of opportunity and ability
(capability) on energy saving behaviours [60]. The strongest indicators of COM constructs in the physical activity model were habits (capability), social support
(opportunity), and identity (motivation). In the eating
model, habits (capability), home environment (opportunity), and self-efficacy (motivation) were the strongest indicators of COM constructs. Taken together, findings
confirm that weight-related behaviours such as eating
and physical activity are associated with a complex combination of an individual’s capabilities, opportunities,
and motivations. Interventions must, therefore, be designed to encompass the full range of enablers and barriers (i.e., levers of change) identified.
Implications for research

Interventions within the context of weight management
often target multiple behaviours. For example, a recent
review [29] found the reported behavioural focus of
weight management interventions targeting young adults
varied considerably with 29% of interventions reportedly
targeting multiple behaviours (e.g. eating, physical activity, stress, and sleep). A further, 42% of interventions reportedly targeted both eating and physical activity.
Unpacking such complex interventions is critical in understanding how they are (or are not) achieving desired
outcomes. Theory can be applied to deconstruct interventions and identify underlying mechanisms of action

Page 11 of 17

[39, 95]; however, research has revealed a general lack of
rigorous theory application in the context of weight
management in young adults, with only a small number
of mainly individual-focused social psychological theories
dominating intervention design [30]. Developing effective interventions for the prevention of weight gain during young adulthood necessitates a theoretical model
that can capture the complexity of weight-related behaviours and permits the systematic identification of underlying mechanisms of action (i.e., enablers and barriers).
Overall, findings support the COM-B model’s capacity
to provide a socio-ecological perspective of young adult’s
eating and physical activity behaviours.
Furthermore, findings support the COM-B model’s
potential to address inherent limitations of dominant social psychological theories by incorporating both rational
and non-rational intra-individual drivers of behaviour,
interpersonal factors, and environmental factors. In so
doing, the COM-B model demonstrates its capacity to
capture the complexity of weight-related behaviours
such as eating and physical activity. In addition, the
method of measurement and analysis used in this study
permitted mechanisms of action (i.e., enablers and barriers) underlying young adult’s eating and physical activity behaviours to be systematically identified within the
COM-B model. These mechanisms of action (i.e., enablers and barriers) form potential targets for future
intervention design.
Several consistencies and variations were observed
across the eating and physical activity models in terms
of the statistically significant indicators capturing latent
COM constructs (see Table 7).
As shown in Table 7, action control and habits were the
only consistent indicators of capability across models. In
terms of variations, action planning was only statistically
significant in the physical activity model, whereas decision
making (cons) was only statistically significant in the eating model. This finding is a likely reflection of the habitual
and often unplanned nature of eating behaviours [96] suggesting that for this specific sample perceived barriers to
behavioural performance were more salient in the context
of eating than in the context of physical activity. Action
control, action planning, and habits are self-regulation
processes that can facilitate behavioural enactment [97,
98]. Research indicates that habit formation is an effective
behavioural regulation strategy that individuals can adopt
to obtain goals and lessen cues from competing behaviours or temptations that can disrupt plans to engage in
healthful behaviours such as physical activity and healthy
eating [99, 100]. The negative association between decision making (cons) and capability is supported by evidence which indicates that if an individual perceives
strong barriers to behavioural change, they are unlikely to
act [48].

For opportunity, subjective norms were the only consistent indicator across models (see Table 7). In terms of
variations, social support was only statistically significant
in the physical activity model, whereas environment
(home and shop) was only statistically significant in the
eating model. Some studies have found subjective norms
and health-related behaviours to be associated [101];
however, the evidence is mixed [49, 93]. Equally, associations between social support and physical activity behaviour have been observed [102–104]. Taken together,
findings suggest that social support may be more salient
in the context of young adult’s physical activity than in
eating. In the eating model, home and shop environments were associated with opportunity. Thus, the more
conducive our environment is to eating healthily, the
more capable we are (or feel we are), and in turn, the
more motivated we are to eat healthily. While accessibility of physical activity facilities can affect level of physical activity [105], descriptive statistics from the present
study suggest environmental context and available resources were conducive to young adult’s physical activity. Thus, a lack of physical opportunity may not have
been salient among this sample of young adults.
For motivation, identity, self-efficacy, and intentions
were the only consistent indicators across models. In
terms of variations, positive affect was only statistically
significant in the physical activity model, whereas perceived behavioural control and attitudes (instrumental
and affective) were only statistically significant in the
eating model. Research suggests that self-identity plays a
key role in motivational processes, intention formation,
and behavioural enactment [106–110] in the context of
physical activity [111, 112] and eating [113]. As such,
young adults who assign themselves a strong identity for

a given behaviour (e.g., exerciser or healthy eater) are
likely to have stronger motivations to perform that behaviour and are subsequently more likely to enact the
behaviour. Similarly, self-efficacy, perceived behavioural
control, attitudes and intentions have all been associated
with eating and physical activity behaviours [49, 92, 93,
114–117] and this link is partially supported by present
study findings where young adults who believed they
were capable, had control, held favourable attitudes,
and/or intentions of being physically active or eating
healthfully were more motivated to engage in the behaviour. Lastly, the presence of positive affect in the physical
activity model suggests that young adults assign positive
emotions (feelings) to physical activity. Thus, positive
emotions associated with physical activity can elicit
automatic motivational processes to engage young
adults in the behaviour.
Implications for practice

Study findings reveal several potential enablers and barriers to young adult’s eating and physical activity behaviours. The mapping of theoretical domains to the latent
COM constructs in the current study permitted the
operationalisation and testing of the COM-B model in
the contexts of young adult’s eating and physical activity
behaviours. Subsequently, key mechanisms of action
(i.e., enablers and barriers) underlying young adult’s eating and physical activity behaviours were able to be systematically identified. These mechanisms of action
represent potential targets for future interventions aiming to promote healthy eating and physical activity in
young adults to support weight management. In the
physical activity model, the strongest indicators of COM
constructs were found to be habits (capability), social

Willmott et al. BMC Public Health

(2021) 21:1014

support (opportunity), and identity (motivation). Similarly, in the eating model, the main indicators of COM
constructs were found to be habits (capability), home
environment (opportunity), and self-efficacy (motivation). Future interventions seeking to positively change
young adult’s healthy eating and physical activity behaviours could be designed and evaluated based on these
identified mechanisms of action. For example, interventions could be built to deliver social support to increase
motivation to engage in physical activity and/or design
supportive food environments to encourage healthy eating. To increase both healthy eating and physical activity, interventions could target young adult’s peers,
friends, and parents delivering positive changes to subjective norms. Habits were strong indicators of capability
in both models; therefore, tactics such as exercise routines, magnets on fridges, smaller food serving ware,
alerts, and other reminders could be embedded within
intervention designs to prompt healthful behavioural
changes.
Furthermore, intervention designers may test the efficiency of universal (e.g., targeting consistent indicators
across contexts) versus tailored behavioural change
strategies (e.g., targeting context-specific indicators) in
terms of return on investment. For example, selfregulation processes (e.g., action control, action planning, and habit) were consistent indicators across
models; therefore, interventionists could integrate strategies designed to support the planning, initiation, and
maintenance of behaviour across both contexts. Conversely, physical environment was only statistically significant in the eating model, whereas social opportunity
was consistent across models. Targeting both the social
and physical environment may not be feasible. Government, infrastructure and urban design, or retailer actions
needed to deliver environmental support and increase
individual motivation to be physically active (e.g.,
provision of cycle and walking paths that are well lit) or
eat healthfully (e.g., supermarket layout and food labelling) take substantial resource investment and time from
initiation to implementation. Thus, selecting the most
consistent factor (e.g., subjective norms) may be more
economical.
Furthermore, understanding how capability and opportunity affect motivation, and in turn, behaviour is
critical to optimising future intervention design. Findings
support the notion that the greater capability and opportunity are, the more likely a behaviour is to occur because of the presence of motivation. In the absence of
opportunity and capability, behaviour is unlikely to
occur as motivation is likely to be lacking. Multicomponent interventions encompassing a range of behavioural
strategies mapped to relevant COM constructs are
needed; however, in the absence of replication studies to

Page 13 of 17

validate present study findings in different samples and
settings, the effectiveness of an intervention designed
based on identified mechanisms of action (i.e., enablers
and barriers) cannot be guaranteed. This study represents an initial step toward the design of a weight management intervention that can effectively alter
capabilities and opportunities to support desired behavioural patterns among young adults and ensure they are
able to act on their motivations to be physically active
and eat healthily.
Limitations and future research directions

Several limitations, many of which offer directions for
future research, are acknowledged. First, findings are
drawn from two convenience samples of young adults
limiting generalisability [23]. Of note, the sample was
predominantly Caucasian, female, and tertiary educated. Consequently, findings are unlikely to be representative of the whole young adult population. Given
research has shown obesity tends to be higher among
women, minority racial/ethnic groups, and at lower
socioeconomic status [118, 119], future research
should aim to recruit a broader and more diverse
sample of young adults.
Second, the self-selective nature of the study likely impacted the diversity of participants recruited [120] such
that participants who were interested in physical activity
and eating behaviours were more likely to be motivated
to complete the survey resulting in self-selection bias.
Research suggests women are generally more interested
in health topics and exhibit more active informationseeking behaviour [121] which may explain why a large
proportion of both samples were female. Males comprise
only 20% of health behaviour research samples [122],
contributing to a lack of evidence on how to increase
their uptake of health promoting behaviours [123]. To
improve generalisability, future research should employ
tailored strategies to ensure a broader spectrum of gender identities are represented.
Third, the subjective nature of self-report measures
may have biased findings. Self-report measures are associated with response bias, inattention, and socially desirable responding [124]. While measures were taken to
minimise potential biases (e.g., use of pre-validated
measurement scales, varied response formats, pilot testing, and staggered dissemination), objective measures
can offer a more reliable and valid method of measurement [125]. Where possible, future research should incorporate objective measures.
Finally, the three explanatory constructs (capability,
opportunity, and motivation in the COM-B model are
not able to be directly observed and are therefore inferred from indicator variables. This study used a new
method of measuring the three explanatory constructs

Willmott et al. BMC Public Health

(2021) 21:1014

in the COM-B model (mapping latent COM constructs
to relevant TDF domains and sourcing indicators of each
domain). While this method has been applied twice previously [58, 59], potential alternatives could be explored.
Future research could explore the potential for an integrated COM-B model to establish whether this approach
alleviates some of the challenges faced in operationalising and testing the COM-B model and/or whether this
approach enhances the explanatory power of the model.
Li et al. [60] offer an example using an integrated MOA
framework. Establishing clear definitions, along with reliable and valid measures of the latent COM constructs,
warrants further attention.

Conclusions
The prevention of weight gain during young adulthood
requires the establishment and maintenance of healthful
behavioural patterns including healthy eating and physical activity. Identifying and understanding the full range
of potential levers of change (i.e., enablers and barriers)
are essential steps in the development of effective weight
management interventions targeting young adults. Findings from the present study support the COM-B model’s
explanatory potential in the contexts of young adult’s
physical activity and eating behaviours. Barriers and enablers underlying young adult’s physical activity and eating behaviours were identified and represent potential
targets for future intervention design. Further research is
needed to validate present study findings across different
populations and settings.

Barriers and facilitators to clinical behaviour
change by primary care practitioners:
a theory‑informed systematic review of reviews
using the Theoretical Domains Framework
and Behaviour Change Wheel
Melissa Mather1* , Luisa M. Pettigrew2,3 and Stefan Navaratnam4

Abstract
Background: Understanding the barriers and facilitators to behaviour change by primary care practitioners (PCPs) is
vital to inform the design and implementation of successful Behaviour Change Interventions (BCIs), embed evidencebased medicine into routine clinical practice, and improve quality of care and population health outcomes.
Methods: A theory-led systematic review of reviews examining barriers and facilitators to clinical behaviour change
by PCPs in high-income primary care contexts using PRISMA. Embase, MEDLINE, PsychInfo, HMIC and Cochrane
Library were searched. Content and framework analysis was used to map reported barriers and facilitators to the
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and describe emergent themes. Intervention functions and policy categories
to change behaviour associated with these domains were identified using the COM-B Model and Behaviour Change
Wheel (BCW).
Results: Four thousand three hundred eighty-eight reviews were identified. Nineteen were included. The average
quality score was 7.5/11. Reviews infrequently used theory to structure their methods or interpret their findings.
Barriers and facilitators most frequently identified as important were principally related to ‘Knowledge’, ‘Environmental
context and resources’ and ‘Social influences’ TDF domains. These fall under the ‘Capability’ and ‘Opportunity’ domains of
COM-B, and are linked with interventions related to education, training, restriction, environmental restructuring and
enablement. From this, three key areas for policy change include guidelines, regulation and legislation. Factors least
frequently identified as important were related to ‘Motivation’ and other psychological aspects of ‘Capability’ of COMB. Based on this, BCW intervention functions of persuasion, incentivisation, coercion and modelling may be perceived
as less relevant by PCPs to change behaviour.
Conclusions: PCPs commonly perceive barriers and facilitators to behaviour change related to the ‘Capability’ and
‘Opportunity’ domains of COM-B. PCPs may lack insight into the role that ‘Motivation’ and aspects of psychological
‘Capability’ have in behaviour change and/or that research methods have been inadequate to capture their function.
Future research should apply theory-based frameworks and appropriate design methods to explore these factors.

With no ‘one size fits all’ intervention, these findings provide general, transferable insights into how to approach
changing clinical behaviour by PCPs, based on their own views on the barriers and facilitators to behaviour change.

Background
Known as the “second translational gap” [1], a gap in
translation between evidence-based interventions and
everyday clinical practice has been shown across different clinical areas and international settings [2–4], with
numerous organisational and individual factors influencing clinical behaviour. Existing literature has shown that
there is particularly wide variation in clinical behaviour
in the primary care setting, which cannot be explained
by case mix and clinical factors alone [5, 6]. This variation is of particular concern, as it is widely accepted that
primary care is the cornerstone of a strong healthcare
system [7], and stronger primary care systems are generally associated with better and more equitable population
health outcomes [8–11]. With an ageing population and
unique evolving challenges faced in primary care, understanding the contextual barriers and facilitators to successful behaviour change by primary care practitioners
(PCPs) is vital to inform the design and implementation
of successful behaviour change interventions (BCIs), and
is likely to offer the greatest potential improvement in
quality of care and population health outcomes.
Behaviour change interventions

Changing behaviour of healthcare professionals is not
easy, but has been shown to be easier when evidencebased theory informs intervention development [12].
BCIs aimed at healthcare professionals have traditionally been related to incentivisation schemes, guidelines,
educational outreach, audit and feedback, printed materials and reminders [13, 14]. These have often emerged
from approaches to understanding behaviour change,
focused on individual attitude-intention processes [15]
and theories emphasising self-interest [16, 17]. However,
the impact of these interventions on changing clinicians’
behaviour has been found to variable [18]. Within the
context of primary care, attitude-intention processes may
not fully explain (lack of ) behaviour change, where PCPs
face competing pressures, such as caring for multiple
patients with limited time, identifying pathology among
undifferentiated symptoms, coping with emotional situations, managing uncertainty and keeping up-to-date with
substantial volumes of new evidence. Similarly, theories

of self-interest may not fully translate to PCPs. BCIs
are often implemented through collective action across
teams or based on financial levers [19–21]; however, the
organisational context where PCPs work can vary from a
single or group community-based practices with variable
payment systems [22]. Therefore, while other healthcare
professionals, patients and carers are likely to offer valuable insights, understanding PCPs’ own perspectives on
the barriers and facilitators to behaviour change by PCPs
is a vital starting point.
Theoretical Domains Framework and Behaviour Change
Wheel

The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) of behaviour change [23] simplifies and integrates 33 theories
and 128 key theoretical constructs related to behaviour
change into a single framework for use across multiple
disciplines. Theoretical constructs are grouped into 14
domains in the final paper by Michie et al. [24], encompassing individual, social and environmental factors, with
the majority relating to individual motivation and capability factors [25] (Fig. 1). Skills can be subcategorised
into cognitive and interpersonal, and physical, although
cognitive and inter-personal skills are more relevant to
primary care (Table 1).
The TDF has been widely used to examine clinical
behaviour change in healthcare settings [25, 27–34].
Key advantages of the TDF include a comprehensive
range of domains useful for synthesising large amounts
of data [24] and the domains can be used to identify the
types of interventions and policy strategies necessary to
change those mechanisms of behaviour, using the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [26]. Developed by Michie
et al., the BCW can be used to characterise interventions by their “functions” and link these to behavioural
targets, categorised in terms of capability (individual
capacity to engage in the activity concerned), opportunity (all the factors that lie outside the individual that
make the behaviour possible or prompt it) and motivation (brain processes that energize and direct behaviour),
known as the COM-B System. Capability encompasses
not only individual physical capability, but also psychological capability, defined as the capacity to engage in the

necessary thought processes using comprehension, reasoning etc. Strategies to modify behaviour can be identified based on salient TDF and COM-B domains [35].
The evidence gap

Never having been done before, the aims of this systematic review of reviews were to:
1) Identify barriers and facilitators to clinical behaviour
change by PCPs through the theoretical lenses of the
TDF and BCW, from the perspective of PCPs.
2) Help inform the future development and implementation of theory-led BCIs, to embed EBM into routine clinical practice, improve quality of care and
population health outcomes.

A systematic review of reviews was deemed an
appropriate method to address these aims, as the literature is substantial and heterogeneous. Existing
reviews of reviews have looked at different types of
effective BCIs, both in primary care [36, 37] and in
healthcare in general [18], however none have looked
at barriers and facilitators to PCPs’ behaviour change,
using both the TDF and BCW models as a theoretical
basis.
We aimed to answer the following questions:
1) Which TDF domains are most frequently identified
as important by PCPs when barriers and facilitators
to clinical behaviour change by PCPs are mapped to
the TDF framework?

2) What important themes emerge within these TDF
domains?
3) What intervention functions and policy strategies
from the COM-B Model and BCW link to these TDF
domains, and what are the implication of this?

Methods
Guidance presented in the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)
Manual for Evidence Synthesis [38] was used as methodological guidance to conduct the review, which provides
guidance for umbrella reviews synthesising qualitative
and quantitative data on topics other than intervention
effectiveness. This guidance, alongside a modified version
of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [39], were used
for reporting (Additional file 1).
Searches

A comprehensive database search strategy was devised
by MM with assistance from a librarian from LSHTM.
The search was conducted by MM on April 16th 2020

without date restriction, using the following databases:
Embase (1947 to 2020 April 14), MEDLINE (1946 to
April week 1 2020), PsychInfo (1806 to April week 1
2020), Health Management Information Consortium
(HMIC) (1979 to March 2020) and Cochrane Library
(inception to April 2020). The full search strategies are
shown in Additional file 2.
In addition, grey literature was hand-searched by MM
on the following websites: Public Health England [40],
the University College London (UCL) Centre for Behaviour Change [41] and the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search [42]. After
screening and selection, reference lists of the included
reviews were screened for additional relevant reviews.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To be included, articles had to be reviews of qualitative,
quantitative or mixed methods empirical studies examining barriers and facilitators to clinical behaviour change
by PCPs. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined
using the PICo framework (Population, phenomena
of Interest, Context) [43], to enable transparency and

Mather et al. Systematic Reviews

(2022) 11:180

reproducibility. The element of ‘types of studies’ was
added to specify types of evidence included (Table 2).
Rationale

Population In most HIC settings, general practitioners/
family doctors are the main providers of primary care,
however often included a mix of PCPs (healthcare professionals working in primary care).
Context PCPs usually provide the mainstay of care in
high-income settings. Common barriers and facilitators
across a wide range of high-income settings provides
stronger evidence for context-specific recommendations.
Types of studies:
• The inclusion of all types of reviews (including but
not limited to narrative and realist reviews, meta-ethnography and meta-aggregation) allows for a broader
review of available literature and they are not bound
by the specificity of systematic reviews [44, 45].
• Only reviews published in English were included.
Screening and selection

Results from database searches were exported to
EndNote X9 software and deduplicated. Titles and
abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers (MM and SN). If the abstract contained insufficient information to determine eligibility, a copy of the

Page 5 of 20

full text was obtained. The full texts of articles meeting the inclusion criteria were obtained and reviewed.
A standardised form including elements of the PICo
framework was used at the full text review stage to
identify relevant articles in a consistent way. Articles
which could not be accessed online were obtained by
contacting authors. Authors were also contacted to
obtain clarification where eligibility was unclear. Reference lists of included articles were hand searched
by MM and SN to identify additional relevant articles,
subject to the same screening and selection processes
described.
Quality appraisal

The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal
Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses [38] was used for quality appraisal, conducted independently by MM and SN. This tool was applicable to
reviews of observational studies, which constituted the
majority of the included articles; therefore, all reviews,
regardless of their type, were subject to quality appraisal
using the JBI checklist. This also allowed for consistency
in scoring and easier comparison between the reviews. A
scoring system was pre-defined using a small sample of
five articles and guidance in the JBI Manual for Evidence
Synthesis [38]. Some articles fulfilled some but not all of
the criteria for each question, which was believed to be
reasonable, therefore an additional ‘partial yes’ response
was added to reflect this (Additional file 3). With a maximum score of 11, scores were used to indicate low (≤
4 points), moderate (> 4 and < 8 points) and high (≥ 8
points) quality. As outlined by Pope and Mays [46], the

value of specific pieces of qualitative research may only
emerge during the synthesis process and may still offer
valuable insights despite low quality. No articles were
therefore excluded on the basis of low quality scores.
Data extraction

The JBI Data Extraction Form for Reviews of Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses [38] was adapted
to extract relevant data from included reviews. A citation matrix was created to map the included empirical studies of each review and identify duplicate
references.
Data analysis and synthesis

Data analysis was conducted independently by MM and
SN. Previously reported analysis methods [25, 47] were
used to guide data analysis and synthesis methods. A
combination of content and framework analysis was
used, described in five steps:
1) Data extraction: full-text versions of the included
articles were imported into NVivo software and data
were extracted from results and discussion sections
and supplementary files. Data included barriers, facilitators and factors which could be both barriers and
facilitators.
2) Deductive analysis: extracted barriers, facilitators and
factors were mapped to relevant TDF domains using
component constructs of each domain, outlined by
Cane et al. [24]. Almost all reported barriers and facilitators related to skills were cognitive and interpersonal,
therefore the TDF domain ‘skills: physical’ was removed.
3) Counts were used to identify the most frequentlyreported TDF domains. Owing to the vast amount of
information across the included reviews, counts were
also used to identify the TDF domains most frequently
reported as important by authors. This was done in
three ways: where authors explicitly stated they were
important or salient, where they were most frequently
reported where authors used frequency counts, and
where authors highlighted or focused on them in the
discussion section to draw main conclusions.
4) Inductive analysis: thematic analysis was conducted
to identify emergent themes within the TDF domains
most frequently identified as important to provide
context to the role each barrier, facilitator and factor plays in hindering or facilitating clinical behaviour change. Owing to the vast amount of information across the included reviews, themes reported
as important or salient by five or more reviews were
labelled as important overall.

Page 6 of 20

5) TDF domains most frequently identified as important were mapped to the COM-B model of the BCW
to identify the associated intervention functions and
policy categories.
Discrepancies between reviewers at the screening,
selection, quality appraisal and analysis stages were discussed until a consensus was reached.

Results
Search results and selection

Database searches identified 6308 records. After duplicates were removed, there were 4374 records remaining.
An additional 14 articles were identified from grey literature and reference list searches. The vast majority of
these articles were either not a review of empirical studies, or they did not focus on behaviour change. Where
they did focus on behaviour change, they focused on
patient behaviour change, rather than that of PCPs. One
hundred and nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Clarification was sought from 19 authors on participant roles, search strategies and synthesis methods,
and was obtained from 11 authors. Nineteen reviews [33,
48–65] were included in the data synthesis (Fig. 2).
Characteristics of included reviews

Of the 19 included reviews, 17 [48–62, 64, 65] were systematic reviews and 2 [33, 63] were narrative reviews.
The reviews were all published between 2005 and 2020.
Four hundred and one empirical studies were included in
total across a wide range of settings and healthcare systems. Almost all studies were conducted in high-income
countries, the majority of which were conducted in
Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Five
studies (1%) were conducted in upper-middle-income
countries, including Jordan, Turkey, South Africa and
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Seven reviews [48–53, 65] only
included qualitative studies, two [54, 55] only included
quantitative studies, and 10 [33, 56–64] included qualitative, quantitative and/or mixed methods studies. Most
studies were observational, utilising qualitative interviews and/or focus groups, or cross-sectional surveys.
A minority of observational studies from six [55, 58, 59,
62–64] reviews were part of larger intervention studies.
More than 72,000 PCPs were included in total. Seven
[33, 48, 49, 52, 55, 63, 64] reviews only reported general
practitioner (GP) or family physician (FP) data and 12
[50, 51, 53, 54, 56–62, 65] reported a mix of PCP data, the
majority of which were GPs, FPs, and community paediatrics and obstetrics and gynaecology physicians. Of
these, five reviews [51, 56, 60, 62, 65] included primary
care non-physicians, including nurse practitioners (NPs)
and physician assistants. Seven reviews [50, 52, 53, 56,

Fig. 2 Flow chart [66] of review process

58, 61, 65] examined behaviour related to clinical management of a range of topics, of which three specifically
examined prescribing behaviour; four reviews [33, 51, 59,
63] examined diagnostic processes; two [49, 54] examined prevention; two [55, 57] examined communication
and engagement with patients; two [48, 64] examined
the practice of EBM in general; one [62] examined collaborative practice; and one [60] examined service provision. Eighteen studies were referenced by two reviews
each due to overlapping phenomena of interest. The most
common data synthesis methods were thematic/narrative synthesis and meta-ethnography, used by 13 reviews
[48–53, 55, 56, 58, 60–62, 65]. Six reviews [33, 54, 57, 59,
63, 64] used framework synthesis; only three reviews [33,
59, 64] used existing theoretical frameworks or models, such as the TDF and COM-B. A summary of review

characteristics is shown in Table 3. Additional information is shown in Additional file 4.
Quality appraisal
Quality of empirical studies

Three reviews [33, 55, 63] did not conduct quality
appraisal, two of which [33, 63] were narrative reviews.
The remaining reviews used a wide range of appraisal
tools to suit the type of data they included, which were
primarily existing tools in their original or adapted
forms. Five reviews [56, 57, 60, 62, 64] used more than
one tool. The most common appraisal tools used were
CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) Checklists [67] for qualitative and quantitative research, used
by seven reviews [48, 52, 53, 56, 57, 59, 65]. There was
large variation in how authors used the appraisal tools,

corresponding quotes.

Quality of reviews

Knowledge (TDF domain) Knowledge, awareness and
uncertainty (theme)

Ten reviews were of high quality, seven were of moderate-quality and two were of low quality using the JBI
checklist. The highest score was 10.5/11 and the lowest
was 3/11. The average score was 7.5/11, which is considered moderate quality. Reviews generally included
well-evidenced recommendations for policy and practice and appropriate directives for future research. On
validity, reviews scored highest on appropriate inclusion criteria for the review question, and appropriate methods used to combine studies. Reviews scored
poorly on using an appropriate search strategy and
assessing for publication bias. Most reviews did not
justify search limits and/or did not provide evidence
of a search strategy. Scores for each of the criteria are
shown in Additional file 3.
Main findings

A large number of barriers, facilitators and factors were
identified by authors, often interacting with each other in
a complex way (Table 4). As a result, some barriers and
facilitators were mapped to more than one TDF domain.
All TDF domains were identified. All reviews identified
‘environmental context and resources’ as important, and
all but two reviews identified ‘knowledge’ and ‘social
influences’ as important. TDF domains identified least
frequently as important were ‘goals’, ‘intentions’ and ‘optimism’. Although ‘social/professional role and identity’,
‘skills’ and ‘emotion’ TDF domains were frequently identified, they were less frequently highlighted as important
by authors. Table 4 shows how each TDF domain and
COM-B domains were mapped to each of the included
reviews, as well as which domains were identified as
important.
Forty-two themes were identified in total across all TDF
domains, 12 of which were labelled as important overall.
A theme was labelled as important overall if five or more
reviews identified it as important or salient. Within the
‘Knowledge’, ‘Environmental context and resources’, and
‘Social influences’ TDF domains, nine important themes
emerged, of which the most frequently cited as important
were ‘knowledge, awareness and uncertainty’ and ‘time,
workload and general resources’. Across the remaining
TDF domains, other important themes included ‘skills
and competence’, ‘roles and responsibilities’, and ‘confidence in own ability’. Additional file 5 shows how themes

Capability: psychological (COM‑B domain)

Identified as important by 13 reviews [33, 50–52, 54, 55,
58–63, 65] (average quality score 7.2/11).
Inadequate knowledge and awareness and uncertainty were identified as important barriers to depression diagnosis and management [51, 56], recognition
of insomnia [33], antibiotic prescribing in childhood
infections [50] and acute respiratory tract infections
(ARTIs) [65], engagement in cancer care [58], integration of genetics services [60], discussing smoking cessation [55], collaborative practice [62], management of
multimorbidity [52], breast and colorectal screening in
older adults [54] and chlamydia testing [59, 63]. This
varied from a lack of knowledge of the topic as a whole,
to more specific skills or outcomes. For example, PCPs
reported a lack of knowledge around the epidemiology
and presentation of chlamydia, benefits of testing, how
to take specimens, and treatment options [59]. When
prescribing antibiotics for childhood infections and
ARTIs, PCPs reported they tend to prescribe “just in
case” when they are uncertain of the consequences of
not prescribing, such as when the diagnosis is unclear,
or where there is no established doctor-patient relationship [50, 65]. There was widespread lack of knowledge within the field of genetics, including uncertainty
around cancer genetics, genetic testing, genetic discrimination legislation, and local genetics service provision [60]. As well as a lack of knowledge of national
guidelines and strategy [60, 63], inadequate guidelines
were reported to exacerbate a lack of knowledge. For
example, a lack of attention in guidelines on how social
problems affect response to depression management
was reported to exacerbate PCPs’ uncertainty around
their role in managing depression [56]. Lack of knowledge and uncertainty were frequently reported to cause
discomfort, low confidence, and reluctance to fill certain roles.

Mather et al. Systematic Reviews

(2022) 11:180

Identified as important by 13 reviews [33, 48, 50, 51, 53–
55, 58–61, 63, 64] (average quality score 7.3/11).
A lack of time to implement a variety of different tasks
and clinical behaviours was reported, compounded
by a large and complex workload and lack of general
resources. A prominent barrier was time-pressured consultations, where PCPs reported difficulty in ensuring the
clinician and parents are satisfied with the outcome when
treating childhood infections [50], offering alternative
interventions [53], listening to patients with depression
[56], discussing emotions in cancer care [58] or smoking
cessation with patients [55], introducing chlamydia testing and addressing sexual health-related concerns [63],
recognising, diagnosing and managing child and adolescent mental health problems [61], and negotiating with
patients [48]. PCPs also reported a lack of time to read
and assess evidence and guidelines and reflect on their
own practice [48, 64].
Guidelines, evidence and decision-making tools
(theme)
Identified as important by five reviews [48, 52, 58, 64, 65]
(average quality score 7.8/11).
Guidelines were a common factor reported to affect clinical behaviour, including a lack of guidelines/guidance,
questionable evidence-base, and a disjunction between
guidelines and personal experience. For example, PCPs
reported difficulty in adapting recommendations to individual patient circumstances and practical constraints of
the consultation [48, 51, 52]. PCPs felt that some guidelines lack the necessary flexibility when taking patient
preferences and multi-morbidity into account, which
can add to complexity and even cause harm in some
cases [52, 64]. PCPs questioned the evidence-base of the
guidelines due to low generalisability and narrow inclusion criteria of trials [48, 64] and potential biased sources
of research, such as pharmaceutical companies [64]. The
validity of criteria used for depression diagnosis was
also questioned, with national guideline criteria defining
depressive disorders using symptom counts, as opposed
to viewing it as a syndrome requiring aetiological and
conceptual thinking [51]. For non-English PCPs, access
to evidence and guidelines in their native language was
reported as a major barrier to implementing EBM [64].
Financial resources and insurance coverage (theme)
Identified as important by 6 reviews [49, 54, 58, 61, 62,
64] (average quality score 8/11).

Page 14 of 20

Poor remuneration and increasing costs were common
barriers reported in areas such as PCP involvement in cancer care [58], child and adolescent mental health [61] and
use of EBM [64]. A major barrier to recognition and management of child and adolescent mental health problems
and cancer in older adults was inadequate insurance coverage, including inadequate coverage of screening tests [54],
restrictions on the number of funded therapy visits, and
lack of psychiatrists [61]. As a result, increased reimbursement was identified as a potential facilitator that could
increase child and adolescent mental health diagnoses [61].
Education and training (theme)
Identified as important by five reviews [33, 59, 63–65]
(average quality score 5.7/11).
A lack of education and training was highlighted as an
important barrier to chlamydia testing [59, 63], recognition of insomnia [33], antibiotic prescribing [65], and use
of EBM [64]. PCPs reported that undergraduate sexual
health teaching is inadequate [63] and that they have a
lack of appropriate training and skills to discuss sexual
health, take a sexual history, offer a test, manage treatment and notify partners. This has led to a reduction in
knowledge and confidence to offer testing and discuss
sexual health [59]. More education and training for PCPs
and undergraduate students was frequently cited as a
facilitator, as PCPs felt this would increase knowledge
and confidence to change behaviour. Older male PCPs
were identified as potentially in need of specific education on sexual health due to cultural differences with
some patients receiving chlamydia testing [59]. Some
PCPs reported that trustworthy and knowledgeable educational sources are important for PCPs to feel added
value, with peer-led educational meetings given as an
example [65].
Opportunity: social (COM‑B domain)

Social influences (TDF domain) PCP-patient relationship and patient-centred care (theme)
Identified as important by nine reviews [48, 49, 51–53,
57–59, 65] (average quality score 8.2/11).
Some PCPs reported that preservation of the PCPpatient relationship is prioritised over adherence to
guidelines, particularly if guidelines recommend rationing services, or if PCPs feel empathetic towards anxious
patients [48]. This dilemma was described as unpleasant

Mather et al. Systematic Reviews

(2022) 11:180

and against the principles of patient-centred medicine,
but sometimes necessary to avoid the potential litigation that rationing might bring [48] and loss of patients
to other practices [53]. Similarly, the desire to maintain a
good relationship is sometimes in competition with the
PCP’s rationing role, leading some PCPs to give patients
a “quick fix” when prescribing benzodiazepines [53].
Although not always reported as important, sensitive
and emotive areas of medicine appear to be particularly
affected, with PCPs reporting a concern for depriving
patients of hope and/or damaging the relationship if
they engage in the process of ACP [57], cancer care [58],
or offer chlamydia testing [63]. Specifically, PCPs worried about appearing discriminatory and judgemental
towards patients by offering chlamydia testing [63], and
being too intrusive and paternalistic in recommending
behaviour change to patients to prevent CVD [49]. This
appears to be compounded by different religious and
cultural norms between the PCP and patient, particularly if patients are of non-heteronormative orientation
[63].
Establishing a rapport with patients and developing a
long-standing, trusting doctor-patient relationship was
identified as a facilitator for information-sharing, depression diagnosis [51], multimorbidity management [52],
changing prescribing behaviour of benzodiazepines [53]
and PCP engagement in ACP [57].
Patient/carer characteristics (theme)
Identified as important by eight reviews [49, 50, 53, 54,
56, 59, 64, 65] (average quality score 8/11).
The majority of reviews identified perceptions of
patient/carer perceived ideas, concerns, expectations
and motivations as important barriers to preventing
CVD [49], prescribing antibiotics [50, 65] and benzodiazepines [53], chlamydia testing [59], cancer screening in older adults [54], and implementing EBM [64].
Attitudes were often born from stigma towards patients
with mental health problems, and cultural diversity
between the PCP and patient. For example, PCPs were
found to have ambivalent attitudes towards working
with depressed people, with some PCPs describing
them as “burdens” and “people who bore you” [56]. Ethnic minorities were also felt to somatise their depression, and patients with social problems were seen to be
avoiding work or seeking to medicalise their problems.
This was compounded by a perception that management
of patients presenting with social problems is complex.
These beliefs were considered alongside other complex external factors, such as perceived pressure from

Page 15 of 20

parents to prescribe antibiotics [50], patient expectations different from the evidence [64], and a reluctance
to medicalise unhealthy lifestyles [49].
Collaboration and communication with other health
professionals (theme)
Identified as important by seven reviews [49, 52, 58, 59,
61, 62, 65] (average quality score 7.8/11).
Poor communication and uncoordinated care between
PCPs and specialists were reported to hinder medication
overviews, creating a feeling of uncertainty around the
role of the PCP [52]. This was compounded by the perception of hierarchy between doctors and nurses [62] and
negative attitudes towards handing over power [59]. Comanagement with specialists was identified as an important facilitator in CVD prevention, to reinforce specialist
advice and strengthen cohesive care [49]. Specialist input
was desired by some PCPs to improve the awareness of
the complexity of multimorbidity among specialists and
ensure all doctors ‘speak with one voice’ to avoid provoking distrust [52]. Discussion with peers and personal or
local prescribing feedback were identified as important
facilitators to changing antibiotic prescribing [65]. Multiple facilitators to collaboration between nurse and medical practitioners in primary care were also identified [62].
These ranged from knowing the practitioner and having a
good working relationship, reciprocity without hierarchy
and control, effective communication including the use
of technology, mutual trust and respect, shared responsibility and support from medical practitioners.
Norms, stigma and attitudes (theme)
Identified as important by five reviews [56, 59, 60, 63, 65]
(average quality score 6.6/11).
The belief that patients would feel stigmatised or embarrassed was identified as an important barrier to depression diagnosis [56], chlamydia testing [59, 63], discussing
family history and genetics [60] and antibiotic prescribing
for ARTIs [65]. Stigma towards depression was seen as an
important barrier to addressing psychosocial aspects of
depression and commencing treatment amongst patients
from the Caribbean and South Asia [56]. Stigmatising
attitudes towards depressed, obese and elderly people
was also reported to impact clinical decision-making
[49, 56] (see ‘Patient and carer characteristics’ section).
A major facilitator to reduce stigma and raise awareness
was the normalisation of chlamydia testing [63]. This may
include formal policy, guidelines or government programmes, feedback on testing rates, different methods of

testing such as urine samples, and the use of non-heteronormative terminology.

(Table 5).

BCW intervention functions and policy categories

Discussion

COM-B components and intervention functions
linked to the three TDF domains most frequently identified as important are shown in Table 5. Based on
this, five intervention functions from the BCW were
identified as most likely to be successful in changing
clinical behaviour by PCPs. Associated with improving ‘capability’ are education (increasing knowledge
or understanding), training (imparting skills) and
enablement (promoting collective action across networks to overcome barriers, such as behavioural support for smoking cessation) interventions. Associated
with improving social and physical ‘Opportunity’ are
restriction (using rules to engage in the target behaviour), environmental restructuring (changing the physical or social context) and enablement interventions.
The TDF domains ‘intentions’, ‘goals’ and ‘optimism’,
which all map to the ‘motivation’ domain of the COMB, were perceived as the least influential on clinical
behaviour change by PCPs. As a result, BCW intervention functions including persuasion, incentivisation,
coercion and modelling may be perceived as less relevant by PCPs to change behaviour.
Using the BCW, the three policy categories most
commonly associated with supporting the delivery
of the five intervention functions identified include
guidelines (creating documents that recommend or
mandate practice, including all changes to service provision), regulation (establishing rules or principles of
behaviour or practice, such as establishing voluntary

Summary of main results

Evidence across all reviews was heterogeneous, examining 16 different clinical behaviours across a range of primary care settings and healthcare systems. Most reviews
were of moderate-to-high quality. All themes identified
from the included reviews could be mapped to at least
one domain from the TDF. Barriers, facilitators and factors most commonly reported by PCPs were related to
‘knowledge’, ‘environmental context and resources’ and
‘social influences’. Within these domains, ‘knowledge,
awareness and uncertainty’ and ‘time, workload and general resources’ were by far the most important themes.
Not only did factors affect various clinical behaviours
such as diagnosis, management, and communication
and collaboration with patients and other healthcare
professionals, factors were also linked to each other in
a complex way, often exacerbating each other in specific contexts and circumstances. For example, a lack of
knowledge and uncertainty amongst PCPs is exacerbated
by a poor or unestablished PCP-patient relationship, lack
of time and resources, as well as patient characteristics,
such as comorbidities and social problems.
Five out of nine intervention functions from the BCW
(education, training, restriction, environmental restructuring and enablement) can be linked to the three
TDF domains reported as most important by PCPs to
help change clinical behaviour. These can be delivered
through all seven policy categories of the BCW, although
those most frequently associated policy categories with

all five intervention categories are guidelines, regulation
and legislation.
The TDF domains ‘intentions’, ‘goals’ and ‘optimism’,
which all map to the ‘motivation’ domain of the COM-B,
were perceived as the least influential on clinical behaviour change by PCPs. The TDF domains ‘behavioural
regulation’, ‘memory, attention and decision processes’,
‘emotion’, ‘beliefs about consequences’, ‘reinforcement’,
and ‘beliefs about capabilities’ were also perceived by
PCPs as less important barriers or facilitators to behaviour change. ‘Behavioural regulation’, and ‘memory, attention and decision processes’ relate to the psychological
aspect of ‘capability’ and the others, again, relate to the
‘Motivation’ domain of COM-B. This is a surprising
finding, as the central premise of the TDF model is that
domains linked to all three areas of the COM-B (capability, opportunity and motivation) model should interact to
produce behaviour [25].
Linked to the automatic and reflective ‘motivation’
domain of COM-B are BCW interventions related to
incentivisation, persuasion, coercion and modelling.
It is therefore also surprising to find that PCPs did not
identify these as important barriers and/or facilitators as
substantial evidence exists regarding the widespread use
of interventions associated with incentives (e.g. financial
pay for performance or reputational league tables—albeit
with mixed effects, and those which may utilise persuasion, modelling and even coercion (e.g. peer-to-peer
outreach or public reporting) to change aspects of PCP
behaviour [14, 68–70].
The limited frequency and importance given to aspects
of psychological ‘Capability’ and ‘Motivation’ raises questions as to whether PCPs may have less insight into these
areas or less desire to identify them as barriers or facilitator. It is possible they may be neglecting the role of brain
processes involved in developing psychological capabilities, i.e. the capacity to engage in the necessary thought
processes using comprehension and reasoning, and those
that energize or direct behaviour, such as habitual processes, emotional responding and automatic decisionmaking. With most studies using qualitative interviews or
cross-sectional surveys, questions may also have focused
on domains researchers and BCI designers believed to be
relevant, such as external factors including time, guidelines and patients.
Key policy implications

Based on our findings, three TDF domains were most
commonly reported across the majority of reviews,
regardless of the type of behaviour change and context. This suggests that addressing these common factors through associated BCW intervention functions

Page 17 of 20

of education, training, restriction, environmental
restructuring and enablement, and applying associated policy categories—namely guidelines, regulation
and legislation, if not already addressed, could be prioritised to encourage PCPs to change clinical practice
where needed across most clinical behaviours and
settings.
Strengths and limitations

The robustness of our findings is supported by several features. A broad, sensitive search strategy maximised the number of eligible reviews identified. Although
the extent to which findings are applicable to a specific
healthcare system or clinical context is unclear, reviews
meeting the inclusion criteria focused on 16 types of
clinical behaviours across a breadth of healthcare systems
and included over 72,000 PCPs, providing a good starting
point to identify commonalities across PCPs from a variety of different primary care settings.
Large amounts of heterogeneous data was summarised
in a clear way using two evidence-based frameworks,
however precise mapping of barriers, facilitators and factors to the TDF proved challenging, owing to the complex interplay between factors and interpretation of the
authors of where they fitted. The integration of the TDF
and BCW means important barriers and facilitators can
be linked to practical strategies to address them, which
does, however, rely on the validity of the frameworks
themselves.
Future research

Only a minority of reviews utilised a theory-based
framework to synthesise evidence. To maximise the
likelihood of intervention success and encourage the
use of common terminology and understanding, future
research should synthesise evidence using theoryinformed frameworks, such as the TDF, paying particular attention to barriers and facilitators to behaviour
change associated with PCPs’ own automatic and reflective motivation, and other aspects of psychological
capability related to behaviour change. Methods exploring PCP motivation and aspects of psychological capability, as well as methods less reliant on PCPs’ insight,
such as direct observation, may provide more valid
conclusions.

Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theory-led
systematic review of reviews examining barriers and
facilitators to clinical behaviour change by PCPs across
a variety of primary care settings using the TDF and
BCW. From the evidence available, PCPs perceive that
factors related to knowledge, environmental context

Mather et al. Systematic Reviews

(2022) 11:180

and resources and social influences are influential
across a variety of primary care contexts, often interacting with each other in a complex way. It is vital that
future research utilises theory-based frameworks and
appropriate design methods to explore factors relating
to automatic and reflective motivation, such as habitual
processes, emotional responding and automatic decision-making that energize or direct behaviour, as well as
psychological capability of PCPs, including the capacity to engage in the necessary thought processes using
comprehension, reasoning etc. With no ‘one size fits
all’ intervention, these findings go some way to offering
general, transferable lessons in how to approach changing clinical behaviour by PCPs and improve quality of
care and population health outcomes.

Effectiveness of smoking cessation
on the high‑risk population of lung cancer
with early screening: a systematic review
and meta‑analysis of randomized controlled
trials until January 2022

Abstract
Background Lung cancer has always been the malignant tumor with the highest incidence rate. Smoking is the
most important risk factor for lung cancer. Although potential positive effects of smoking cessation interventions on
the high-risk population of lung cancer have been observed, evidence of its definitive effect remains uncertain. This
study aimed to summarize the evidence related to the effects and safety of smoking cessation interventions for the
high-risk population of lung cancer.
Methods A systematic literature search was conducted through the following seven databases: PubMed, Embase,
Web of Science, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Science Direct. Screening and assessment for risk of bias were
conducted by two independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed for the 7-day-point prevalence of smoking
abstinence and continuous smoking abstinence using RevMan 5.3 software.
Results Meta-analysis results show that in the 7-day-point prevalence of smoking abstinence (by patientreported outcome): individualized intervention was significantly higher than that of the standard care [RR = 1.46,
95%CI = (1.04,2.06), P < 0.05]. Moreover, the smoking cessation interventions were significantly elevated than that
of standard care [RR = 1.58, 95%CI = (1.12, 2.23), P < 0.05] within 1–6 month follow-up time. In line with the findings
in cigarette smoking, the continuous smoking abstinence of E-cigarettes (biochemical verified): E-cigarettes were
significantly higher than that of the standard care [RR = 1.51, 95%CI = (1.03, 2.21), P < 0.05], and within 1–6 month
follow-up time, the smoking cessation interventions were significantly greater than that of standard care [RR = 1.51,
95%CI = (1.03, 2.21), P < 0.05]. Publication bias was detected possibly.
Conclusions The results of this systematic review show that smoking cessation intervention is effective for longterm lung cancer high-risk smokers who participate in early screening, of which E-cigarettes are the best, followed by
individual smoking cessation.

Background
Lung cancer has been the most common malignant
tumor, according to the most recent statistics on cancer
in the world provided by the American Cancer Society.
It is also the leading cause of death among all cancer
patients, accounting for 18.4% of all cancer deaths globally with an 18.6% average 5-year survival rate [1, 2]. The
family, economic, and social burdens caused by lung
cancer are increasing worldwide [3, 4]. The leading incidence and mortality of lung cancer are largely attributed
to smoking behavior. According to the Global Burden of
Disease Study, the number of smokers increased to 1.1
billion in 2019 worldwide [5]. The International Agency
for Research on Cancer showed that over 4000 chemical
agents in cigarette smoke, 60 of which are well-known
carcinogens [6], long-term smoking increases the risk of
lung cancer by 10–30 folds compared to non-smokers,
which makes smoking one of the most important risk
factors for lung cancer [7, 8]. In addition, cigarette smoke
may have the ability not only to promote lung cancer but
also influence directly or indirectly the efficacy and the
tolerability of many chemotherapeutics through complex
pharmacokinetic [9]. It is known that smoking cessation
can reduce the risk of lung cancer. Ex-smokers who have
quit smoking for 15 years showed 38% lower mortality when they developed lung cancer compared to current smokers [10], indicating that smoking cessation has
a major beneficial effect on the survival of lung cancer,
smoking cessation program has to be considered crucial
along with specific therapy for cancer [9]. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and The Tobacco
Use Treatment Association strongly recommend smoking cessation intervention as a precondition for initiating
early screening programs for lung cancer [11, 12]. One
of the key causes of lung cancer’s poor prognosis is the
challenge of early diagnosis. Approximately 70% of lung
cancer patients were diagnosed at an advanced stage, and
around one-third of patients died within 3 months after
diagnosis [13]. It is estimated that the five-year survival
rate of lung cancer can be increased by roughly 75% with
an early diagnosis which may subsequently reduce lung
cancer mortality [14]. The National Lung Screening Trial
reported that early lung cancer screening with low-dose
computed tomography reduced the mortality of patients
with lung cancer by 20% [15]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines also pointed out that

conducting early screening and diagnosis for those who
are at high risk of developing lung cancer is crucial, especially for people aged 55 to 74 years with a minimum of
30 pack years of smoking [16]. Early screening provides
the option to detect lung cancer earlier before the disease
develops into an advanced stage. In the meantime, the
implementation of early screening aids in drawing longterm smokers’ attention to the critical role smoking plays
in an elevated risk of lung cancer. This could motivate
smokers who are at high risk of developing lung cancer to
give up and make themselves open to smoking cessation
treatments [17–19]. However, studies have shown that
most smokers who participate in lung cancer screening
continue to smoke [20]. Therefore, health care workers
have been actively looking for a better system for carrying out smoking cessation intervention, encouraging
the high-risk population for lung cancer to quit smoking
effectively and reduce the incidence of lung cancer.
Although existing systematic reviews found that
smoking cessation interventions included long-term
use of pharmacotherapy, high tech ereferral systems,
national quitting programmes, quitting apps, enhanced
counselling, and an opt-out referral system, etc. [21]
and smoking cessation intervention has a potentially
positive effect on the prognosis of long-term high-risk
smokers with lung cancer, a comprehensive search and
adequate reporting of clinical randomized controlled trials are lacking [19, 22, 23]. There are very few reviews
have provided quantitative analysis of existing data to
demonstrate the effect of smoking cessation intervention on lung cancer in long-term high-risk smokers. Systematic reviews or meta-analysis including high-quality
randomized controlled trials is considered to be a valuable addition to the field. Therefore, the purpose of this
systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation intervention in long-term high-risk smokers who participated in
early screening to determine which smoking cessation
methods are more effective in reducing lung cancer incidence in terms of quantity and quality.

Methods
This study was conducted under the standards of The
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [24] and registered
in the International Prospective Register of Systematic

Review database (Trial registration: CRD42019147151.
Registered 23 June 2022).
Data sources and search strategy

Two authors (Huang and Tang) performed the search
independently. A total of 7 electronic databases, including PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Web
of Science, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, and Science Direct, were searched for relevant
studies published before January 2022. No language
restrictions were applied. We also read the reference
of the included studies to find potential eligible references. The search used a combination of MESH terms,
keywords, and free words, such as ‘Tobacco Use Cessation’, ‘Smoking Cessation’, ‘Tobacco Use Disorder’, ‘Early
Detection of Cancer’, ‘Lung Neoplasms’, and ‘Randomized
Controlled Trial’. The detailed search strategy used in this
study can be found in the Additional file 1.
Eligibility criteria

Studies were considered eligible if they met all the following criteria: (a) design in the randomized controlled
trial; (b) participants: smokers who smoked ≥ 30 packs/
year and stopped smoking < 15 years, regardless of sex;
(c) interventions: studies comparing smoking cessation
interventions to standard care, including authoritative
smoking cessation materials, placebo or other therapies
with similar co-interventions between intervention and
control groups; types of smoking cessation interventions
can be any network resource, individualized intervention, and replacement therapy; (d) outcome measures:
the main outcome measures were smoking abstinence,
which can be verified by patient-reported or biochemical
verification. The outcome measures included in the analyzed studies were a 7-day-point prevalence of smoking
abstinence (smoking cessation rate within 7 days before
follow-up) and continuous smoking abstinence (never
smoking during the period from the date of quitting
smoking till the end of follow-up); the secondary outcome measure was side effects. The study was excluded
when met the following criteria: (a) case reports, case–
control studies, reviews, protocols, or animal experimental studies; (b) studies without smoking abstinence as
part of the outcome measure; (c) duplicated publications;
and (d) incomplete or unavailable data.
Study selection

All studies were independently screened by two coauthors (Huang and Tang) according to the inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Two co-authors (Huang and
Tang) used the homemade standardized table for data

Page 3 of 14

extraction and cross-checking. If any discrepancies were
generated, a third person (Yang) was involved to make
the decision. The original authors were approached for
the confirmation of unclear details for some studies when
it was necessary.
Data extraction

The data from each study were extracted using a standardized table containing the following information: (a)
first author, publication date, and study sites; (b) demographic data of subjects, such as type of sample, age,
and sex of subjects; (c) intervention program, such as
smoking cessation interventions, duration of treatment,
frequency of treatment and follow-up; (d) outcome measures; and (e) smoking cessation interventions-related
adverse events.
Quality assessment

The risk of bias was assessed for each included study
according to The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions Version 6.1 [25] which includes
the evaluation in the following seven aspects: random
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blind
method of participants, blind method of result evaluation, incomplete result data, selective result report, and
other deviations [25]. The individual studies were rated
as low, unclear, or high bias risk for the mentioned 7
aspects. The risk of bias assessment was independently
completed by two reviewers (Huang and Tang) and crosschecked. When there was disagreement regarding the
study’s bias assessment, Yang was brought in as a third
party to resolve the issue.
Data synthesis and presentation

RevMan 5.3 (developed by the Cochrane Collaboration)
was used for data analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed
using Q statistics and the I2 index. When the heterogeneity test resulted in P ≥ 0.1 with I2 < 50%, the fixed-effects
model was used for meta-analysis. When the heterogeneity test resulted in P < 0.1 with I2 ≥ 50%, a subgroup
analysis or sensitivity analysis was performed to determine potential sources of clinical heterogeneity before
the meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effects
model [25]. Descriptive analysis was performed on studies with significant clinical heterogeneity when I2 ≥ 75%.
Relative risk (RR) was used for dichotomous data. For
continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was calculated when outcome measures were collected using the
same research instrument [25]. Otherwise, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was utilized. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
A total of 2002 studies were found from the initial search,
from which 1596 unique potentially eligible studies were
selected after removing the duplicate. After reading the
title and abstract of those studies, 1553 studies were
excluded for inconformity to the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. The next step was to thoroughly read the full
text of 43 records to determine their eligibility. Of these,
35 studies were found to be ineligible because they were
clinical trial registrations (n = 2), reviews (n = 2), methodology publications (n = 1), or non-randomized controlled
studies (n = 11). Additionally, 16 records were found to
not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, 8 studies were
identified for the subsequent meta-analysis. The selected
PRISMA flow chart is shown in Fig. 1.
Summary of study details and participant characteristics

As a result, 8 studies were included in this study for
the following analysis, all of which were English studies published between 2004 and 2022 [26–33]. A total of
988 participants aged 57 to 63 were included. Two were
from the United States [31, 33], two were from Italy
[28, 30], two were from Canada [27, 29], one was from
Australia [32] and the last one was from England [26].

Among them, Tremblay et. al. published a follow-up
article [27] of their work published in 2019 [29] with an
extra set of data collected at a time point that was later
than in their previous publication. Similar to the articles
from Masiero et. al [30]. and Lucchiari et al. [28] which
were the same study with 3 and 6 months-observation
time individually. Therefore, these four articles were
considered as two studies, “S4 Tremblay, et al.” [27, 29]
and “Masiero & Lucchiari, et al.” [28, 30] in this analysis.
All studies clearly described the specific intervention
methods of smoking cessation interventions. The study
of Clark M.M. et. al [33] came from network resources
vs standard care. Four studies [26, 27, 29, 31, 32] were
selected from individualized intervention vs standard
care, which provided personalized smoking cessation
services for smokers by taking advantage of inquiring
about their smoking motivation and addiction degree,
combining the screening results, including counseling,
suggestions, and interviews. The S5 Masiero & Lucchiari study [28, 30] used E-cigarette + low-intensity
telephone consultation and placebo + low-intensity telephone consultation as smoking cessation interventions
to provide smoking cessation intervention. The comparison between “E-cigarette + low-intensity telephone

consultation” and “low-intensity telephone consultation” was defined as the group (A), and the comparison between “E-cigarette + low-intensity telephone
consultation” versus “placebo + low intensity telephone
consultation” was defined as the group (B). Taylor KL
et. al [31] reported that the time of intervention lasted
for 15–20 min, the duration of intervention was one
day which lasted for 6 weeks. The S5 Masiero & Lucchiari study [28, 30] reported that the duration of intervention lasted 12 weeks. The main outcome indicators
included in the literature were 7-day-point prevalence
and continuous smoking abstinence, which were evaluated by the patient-reported outcome and biochemical
verification. Concerning the 7-day-point prevalence,
four studies [26, 27, 29, 32, 33] used patient-reported
outcomes, and other studies [31] used both patientreported outcomes and biochemical verification.
Regarding continuous smoking abstinence, Clark M.M.
[33] used patient-reported outcome, S5 Masiero & Lucchiari study used biochemical verification [28, 30] and
the Tremblay study used both patient-reported outcome
and biochemical verification. In addition, Masiero &
Lucchiari [28, 30] reported smoking cessation interventions-related adverse events, including burning throat,
cough, nausea, headache, insomnia, stomachache, confusion, and dyspnea. The 7-day-point prevalence was
recorded by patient-reported with the follow-up time
of 1–6 months for 4 studies [26, 27, 29, 31, 33] respectively, within 6–12 months for two studies [27, 29, 32]
and within 12–24 months for one study [27, 29]. Of
note, the “Tremblay, et al.” study used 3 different time
points of follow-up data collection, the follow-up time
within 1–6 months, 6-12 months, and 12–24 months
are defined as S4 Tremblay, et al. (a), S4 Tremblay, et al.
(b) and S4 Tremblay, et al. (c) respectively. In the continuous smoking abstinence, by the patient-reported outcome, Tremblay study [27, 29] was with follow-up time
within 1–6 months, 6–12 months, and 12–24 months,
respectively; one study [28, 30] with a follow-up time of
1–6 months was verified by biochemical verification. In
S5 Masiero & Lucchiari [28, 30] the data of two followup periods were collected by biochemical verification.
In this study, “S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al. (A)” for
three months was defined as “S5 Masiero & Lucchiari,
et al. (a)”, “S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al. (B)” for three
months was defined as “S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al.
(b)”, “S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al. (A)” for 6 months
was defined as “S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al. (c)”, and
“S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al. (B)” for 6 months was
defined as “S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al. (d)”. All studies include a report for follow-up after the intervention.
The details are shown in Table 1.

Study quality assessment

The risk of bias in the included studies is shown in Fig. 2.
All selected studies were randomized control studies.
Five studies [26–32] explicitly reported the randomization method. One used a random number generator [32],
one used the randomization list [28, 30], three used computerized randomization [26, 27, 29, 31], and the remaining one did not explicitly describe the randomization
method [33]. Meanwhile, four studies reported that a
special person was responsible for the distribution concealment of random numbers [26, 28, 30–32], one study
failed to carry out distribution concealment [27, 29], and
the remaining one study described insufficient information with an unclear risk of bias [33]. In addition, two
studies indicated the blinding of participants and personnel together with the blinding of outcome assessments
[26, 28, 30], the remaining four studies provided insufficient information [27, 29, 31–33]. In general, all studies
presented a low risk of bias for selective outcome reporting and complete outcome data. Except for two studies
[26, 28, 30], 4 out of 6 studies did not provide enough
information for the evaluation of whether other biases
were existing [27, 29, 31–33]. Publication bias was not
determined because of the limited number of included
studies (less than 10) for each comparison.
Meta‑analysis
Primary outcome: 7‑day‑point prevalence of smoking
abstinence

Five studies [26, 27, 29, 31–33] reported the effect of
smoking cessation interventions on the 7-day-point prevalence of smoking abstinence by the patient-reported
outcome. The results of outcomes were analyzed in subgroups according to different smoking cessation interventions and follow-up times, and the above five studies
were included in both subgroups.
The fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis
because low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) was detected, and
the results showed that the smoking cessation interventions group was significantly higher than the standard
care group [RR = 1.50, 95% CI = (1.08, 2.08), P < 0.05].
This result indicated that smoking cessation intervention has a substantial influence on the high-risk population of lung cancer (P < 0.05). The results of subgroup
analysis by smoking cessation interventions showed that
there were no significant differences between network
resources and standard care [RR = 1.93, 95% CI = (0.62,
6.08), P > 0.05]. However, the individualized intervention was considerably higher than that of standard care
[RR = 1.46, 95% CI = (1.04,2.06), P < 0.05]. These results
indicated that individualized intervention has a substantial effect on high-risk populations of lung cancer

than standard care (P < 0.05). A more detailed forest
plot is available in Fig. 3.
According to the result of the subgroup divided by
follow-up time in the patient-reported outcome, the
fixed effects model was used for meta-analysis because
of low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). The results showed that
the smoking cessation interventions group was considerably greater than the standard care group [RR = 1.34,
95% CI = (1.05, 1.69), P < 0.05], this result proved that
smoking cessation intervention had a remarkable effect
on the high-risk population of lung cancer (P < 0.05). The
subgroup of follow-up time within 1–6 months showed
that the smoking cessation interventions group was
markedly higher than the standard care group [RR = 1.58,
95% CI = (1.12, 2.23), P < 0.05]. This result indicated that
smoking cessation intervention within 1–6 months had
a huge influence on the high-risk population of lung
cancer (P < 0.05). While at 6–12 months [RR = 1.22, 95%
CI = (0.81, 1.84), P > 0.05] and 12–24 months [RR = 1.02,
95% CI = (0.59, 1.77), P > 0.05], no significant difference
between the two groups was observed. A more detailed
forest plot is shown in Fig. 4.

Primary outcome: continuous smoking abstinence

Three studies [27–30, 33] reported the effect of smoking
cessation interventions on continuous smoking abstinence. According to different smoking cessation interventions and follow-up times, the results of the outcomes
were divided into subgroups, and a total of three studies

were included in the smoking cessation interventions
subgroups. The other two studies were divided into subgroups according to different follow-up times.
The fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis
because of low heterogeneity (I2 = 21%). There was no significant difference between smoking cessation interventions and standard care [RR = 1.34, 95% CI = (0.99,1.81),
P > 0.05]. The results of subgroup analysis by smoking cessation interventions showed that E-cigarette [RR = 1.51,
95% CI = (1.03, 2.21), P < 0.05] was higher than that of
the network resource [RR = 0.45, 95% CI = (0.14,1.40),
P > 0.05] and individualized intervention [RR = 1.41, 95%
CI = (0.80,2.94), P > 0.05]. These results indicated that
E-cigarette had a determinate effect on high-risk population of lung cancer than standard care (P < 0.05). A more
detailed forest plot is available in Fig. 5.
According to the follow-up time in biochemical verification within 6 months, the fixed effects model was
used for meta-analysis because of low heterogeneity
(I2 = 0%). The results showed that within 1–6 months,
the smoking cessation interventions group was significantly higher than the standard care group [RR = 1.51,
95% CI = (1.03, 2.21), P < 0.05], this result indicated that
smoking cessation intervention within 1–6 months had a

significant effect on the high-risk population of lung cancer (P < 0.05). A more detailed forest plot is available in
Fig. 6. Furthermore, only one study [27, 29] reported biochemical verification at the 12-month follow-up (22/171
vs 19/174, P = 0.58). There was no significant difference
in the continuous smoking cessation at the twelfth month
between smoking cessation interventions and standard
care.
In addition, one study [27, 29] reported the continuous smoking cessation rate verified by the patientreported outcome. At the sixth-month follow-up (25/171
vs 18/174, P = 0.229), at the twelfth-month follow-up
(24/171 vs 22/174, P = 0.704), and at the 24-month follow-up (36/168 vs 31/169, P = 0.48). There was no discernible difference in the rate of continuous smoking
cessation between standard care and smoking cessation
treatments.
Secondary outcome: adverse events

Out of the five included studies, only one study [28, 30]
reported adverse events, such as burning throat, cough,
nausea, headache, insomnia, stomachache, confusion,
and dyspnea, which were caused by the usage of E-cigarettes. At the same time, placebo also reported the above

adverse reactions, but the number was less than that of
electronic cigarettes.
Sensitivity analysis

In this study, sensitivity analysis was conducted for each
outcome index by using sequential omission of each
study. No significant changes in the effect size were
found.

Discussion
The results of the meta-analysis showed that in terms of
the continuous smoking cessation rate, the smoking cessation effect of E-cigarettes was 1.51 times higher than

that of standard care. In addition, the smoking cessation
effect was statistically significant. In terms of the 7-day
smoking cessation rate, the effect of individualized smoking cessation was 1.46 times greater than that of standard
care, which improved the influence of smoking cessation.
The results of the subgroup analysis of follow-up time
showed that the smoking cessation impact of smoking
cessation interventions within 6 months was better than
that of standard care, not after 6 months.
The subjects of this systematic review are long-term
smokers who undergo low-dose computed tomography,
and the outcomes of this screening can help smokers
become more aware of the negative effects of smoking

Huang et al. Archives of Public Health

(2023) 81:101

and the advantages of quitting [34]. Smokers seeking lowdose computed tomography screening results are often at
high risk of lung cancer, as stubborn smokers are highly
dependent on nicotine and have a higher risk of lung cancer than ordinary smokers [34]. Some researchers [22]
believed that the results of low-dose computed tomography screening can change the motivation of high-risk
people to quit smoking, and the fear of lung cancer for
high-risk groups can frequently become an important
motivation for them to quit smoking [35]. The results of
screening with low-dose computed tomography significantly influence the rate of smoking cessation. A study
reported that [33] positive screening results can increase
the quitting rate of smokers, while negative screening
results may even reduce smokers’ awareness of cancer risk thus continuing to smoke. It is well known that
smoking is not only a high-risk factor for lung cancer but
also leads to other multisystem damage [30]. It is necessary to publicize the harmful effects of smoking and make
smokers aware of the benefits of quitting smoking, especially for smokers whose screening results are negative.
Unfortunately, the six studies included in this systematic
review did not include the results of low-dose computed
tomography screening as a factor affecting the rate of
quitting smoking in the analysis. Future studies should
consider the impact of low-dose computed tomography
screening results on smoking cessation interventions,
which can explore potential smoking cessation methods
suitable for smokers with different low-dose computed
tomography screening results to guide clinical research.
The smoking cessation interventions included in this
systematic review include network resources, individualization and E-cigarettes. Among them, both network
resources and individualization are categorized as psychological and behavioral intervention, and E-cigarettes
are categorized as pharmacological approach [36]. The
findings demonstrate that electronic cigarettes significantly affect smoking cessation. E-cigarettes are electronic devices that evaporate nicotine into aerosols for
smokers to inhale. It provides smokers with sufficient
levels of nicotine to help relieve withdrawal symptoms
by simulating smoking behavior, vision, and perception
[37]. Nicotine is an addictive substance in tobacco. Once
smokers stop smoking, there will be a series of withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, irritability, inattention, fatigue, etc. [38]. Research shows that most people’s
failure to quit smoking is due to abstinence reactions
caused by a sudden interruption of nicotine in the process of quitting smoking [39]. Appropriate nicotine supplementation can reduce smokers’ mental dependence
on nicotine, which in turn reduces nicotine craving and
withdrawal symptoms. The results of this study show that
E-cigarettes support people at high risk of lung cancer to

Page 10 of 14

quit smoking in the short term, which is consistent with
the results of Harrell et. al [40]. However, despite their
ability to aid in quitting smoking, e-cigarettes can cause
unwanted respiratory side effects as cough, nauseousness, and dyspnea. Therefore, it is advised that clinical
practice should make a wise decision to stop smoking
based on thoroughly assessing its smoking cessation
effect and negative effects. Because the study included
in this systematic review only followed up on the effect
of E-cigarettes for 6 months, therefore we were unable to
determine the effect of e-cigarettes over the long term.
Future research is hoped to follow up on the long-term
effects of e-cigarettes and thus evaluate the long-term
effects of quitting smoking.
Individual smoking cessation intervention aims at a
series of tobacco dependence, smoking habit preference,
psychological state of smoking cessation for smokers, and
addressing the diverse demands of many sorts of smokers in terms of quitting smoking [26, 32]. Condoluci,
et al. [9] declared that the individual smoking cessation
interventions should be tailored according to the different smoking habits of smokers. The results of this systematic review shows that individual smoking cessation
intervention is effective in the 7-day smoking cessation
rate and ineffective in the continuous smoking cessation rate. This indicates that individual smoking cessation intervention can promote smoking cessation. The
difference in the smoking cessation effect between network resources and standard care has not been found,
although internet resources improve smokers’ desire for
tobacco and control of smoking pleasure through social
support [41]. For smokers who have smoked for at least
15 years, their physical and psychological dependence on
nicotine is extremely high, and the withdrawal symptoms
associated with quitting smoking are serious. A study
found that [33] long-term smokers with a high risk of
lung cancer. Their utilization rate of network resources is
low, and the influence of network resources on smoking
cessation drive and motivation of long-term lung cancer high-risk people is weak. It is suggested that future
research strengthen social support for smoking cessation,
such as through media publicity and public welfare activities. Improving the utilization rate of smoking cessation
resources for smokers and then encouraging them to quit
smoking.
The results of this systematic review subgroup analysis
shows that the smoking cessation rate of smoking cessation interventions is significantly higher than that of
standard care within 6 months of follow-up. However, the
effect of smoking cessation interventions decreased gradually with the extension of follow-up time. Smokers who
participated in low-dose computed tomography screening are at high risk of lung cancer, and participating in

Huang et al. Archives of Public Health

(2023) 81:101

low-dose computed tomography screening itself has a
warming effect on them. They may caution themselves to
try their best to stop smoking and retain a comparatively
high degree of recall and attention to smoking cessation
therapies in a short period while getting smoking cessation intervention. This may be the reason why smoking
cessation interventions are effective in quitting smoking
in a short period. However, in reality, it can be challenging to continue their behavior of stopping smoking for an
extended period. The gap between the intervention and
measurement times is too wide, smokers’ memories of
their interventions to stop smoking steadily deteriorate,
and some smokers are unable to recall the occurrence
of their interventions at all. With the extension of time,
their shadow on low-dose computed tomography gradually weakened. At the same time, with the cumulative
increase in withdrawal reaction caused by quitting smoking, they suffered great physical and psychological pain,
which seriously affected the effect of smoking cessation
interventions quitting smoking [42]. Our study observed
that the effect of smoking cessation interventions on
smokers’ memory and compliance to quitting smoking is
limited by time. Therefore, it is suggested that the clinical implementation of smoking cessation interventions
should be continuously strengthened and consolidated
more intensively, especially after 6 months of intervention. Smokers’ internal driving force and motivation to
quit smoking are gradually decreasing with the extension
of time, and it is easy to give up psychologically. Because
of smokers’ strong dependence on tobacco and forgetting about smoking cessation interventions, which makes
the success rate of quitting smoking is lower in high-risk
groups for lung cancer. Thus, it is necessary to increase
the intensity of smoking cessation interventions or make
appropriate adjustments for other more effective measures [10].
The present research revealed that in most studies,
researchers mostly take the smoking cessation rate as
the main outcome indicators [43, 44], such as the 7-day
smoking cessation rate and the continuous smoking cessation rate. The 7-day quitting rate refers to the quitting
rate within 7 days before the follow-up, and the continuous quitting rate refers to never smoking during the
period from the date of quitting smoking to the end of the
follow-up. The 7-day smoking cessation rate and continuous quitting rate are common end points for researchers to observe the short-term and/or long-term effects
of smoking cessation interventions, which are important
measurement standards for evaluating smoking cessation effectiveness[45]. During a given follow-up period,
it can be considered that the continuous quitting rate is
more stringent than the 7-day quitting rate [46]. Among
the 6 studies included in this systematic review, only one

Page 11 of 14

article, “S4 Tremblay, et al.”, observed the continuous
smoking cessation rate of smokers, which may be the reason for the ineffectiveness of individualized smoking cessation intervention in the continuous smoking cessation
rate. These outcome indicators are evaluated by patientreported outcomes or biochemical verification. patientreported outcome refers to the research results directly
reported by patients themselves. As an evaluation tool,
it can directly and comprehensively reflect the true feelings of patients and contribute to patient-centered treatment [47]. Biochemical verification evaluates the results
of quitting smoking by monitoring the level of carbon
monoxide in smokers, which improves the science and
rigor of the trial. The inclusion of biochemical verification in clinical research design can greatly improve the
quality of the study [48]. However, only using patientreported outcome or/(and) biochemical verification to
evaluate the physiological changes of smokers, there is
a certain level of limitation in the adoption of outcome
indicators and the choice of evaluation methods, and
the lack of observation of the psychological and behavioral changes of smokers, such as the change in smoking
abstinence expectancies [49], motivation to quit smoking, the number of attempts to quit smoking and the
degree of nicotine dependence, can be used as secondary
outcome indicators of smoking cessation intervention.
These data can also provide clues for improving smoking
cessation interventions [11]. In addition, the degree and
duration of smoking cessation interventions intervention were closely related to the effect of quitting smoking [50]. Among the 6 studies included in this systematic
review, only one article, “S3 Taylor, et al.” [31] described
the degree and duration of intervention, and the other,
“S5 Masiero & Lucchiari, et al.” [28, 30] described the
duration of intervention. Other studies have not reported
the specific degree and time of smoking cessation intervention, which reduces the repeatability of the intervention and may also affect the judgment of the intervention
effect in this study.
It is suggested that future studies fully report the research
design, include a more detailed process and effect evaluation, and use a variety of methods to verify the effectiveness of the results to observe the smoking cessation effect
of smoking cessation interventions more comprehensively.
Limitations

There may be some limitations in this study. First,
although the quality of the literature [26, 28, 30] in this
study is high, it is still partly included in the poor quality of the articles, resulting in low quality of evidence
potentially. Second, the literature we included was published in English. Studies published in other languages
and studies that have been completed but not yet

Huang et al. Archives of Public Health

(2023) 81:101

published may be omitted, resulting in publication and
publication bias.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the results of this systematic review show
that smoking cessation intervention is effective for longterm lung cancer high-risk smokers who participate in
early screening. Among them, E-cigarettes are the best,
followed by individual smoking cessation. Future research
should focus on improving the methodological quality of
the trial, shortening the intervention period, and exploring more outcomes. Further studies should consider both
the negative and positive influence of the low dose computed tomography screening population and report the test
according to CONSORT guidelines; additionally, future
research can also evaluate the smoking cessation effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions by observing
changes in end points such as Fagestrom test, pack years,
eCO, and spirometry; the smoking abstinence expectancies questionnaire (SAEQ) can be used to evaluate smoking
abstinence expectancies [49]. This would help to explore
smoking cessation interventions more comprehensively to
provide scientific evidence of smoking cessation methods
for long-term smokers at high risk of lung cancer.

ackground: Although the hospital inpatient setting arguably provides an ideal opportunity to engage patients in smoking cessation interventions, this is done infrequently. We therefore aimed to
systematically review the perceived barriers to the implementation of smoking cessation interventions
in the hospital inpatient setting.
Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted specific to hospital-based healthcare workers’ perceived barriers to implementing smoking cessation interventions. Reported barriers were categorised using the capability, opportunity and motivation (COM-B) framework.
Results: Eighteen studies were selected for inclusion, which consisted of cross-sectional surveys and
interviews. The most commonly identified barrier in capability was lack of knowledge (56% of studies);
in Opportunity, it was a lack of time (78%); while in Motivation, a lack of perceived patient motivation to
quit smoking (44%). Seventeen other barriers were also endorsed, but less frequently.
Conclusion: Healthcare workers report a plethora of barriers to providing smoking cessation interventions in hospital settings, which cover all aspects of the COM-B framework. These impediments need
to be addressed in a multidisciplinary approach, at clinical, educational, and administrative levels, to
improve intervention provision.

Introduction
The World Health Organization identifies smoking as
the leading cause of preventable death internationally,
with 4.9 million deaths per year (World Health Organization 2003). In 2012, the amount of healthcare expenditure due to smoking-attributable diseases totalled 5.7%
of global health expenditure (Goodchild, Nargis, & Tursan d’Espaignet, 2016). Worldwide, more than one billion people smoke tobacco, or identify as smokers (World
Health Organization 2017). While this number is decreasing year-by-year, smoking-related illness remains a large
proponent of respiratory and cardiac disease. Tobacco
control should be at the forefront of every future nationwide healthcare policy. To this end, a 2012 Cochrane review, by Rigotti et al., demonstrated the effectiveness of
brief smoking cessation interventions, on patients, when
given by a healthcare professional (Rigotti, Clair, Munafo,
& Stead, 2012; Smith, Reilly, & Houston Miller, 2002).
Hospitalised patients, in particular, are more receptive

to intervention than the general population, especially
those who have been admitted with tobacco-related disease (McBride, Emmons, & Lipkus, 2003). The inpatient
hospital setting provides an optimal time for intervention, as healthcare workers are clearly able to identify patients who smoke tobacco (Raupach et al., 2012). The inpatient setting provides other inherent incentives, such as
increased patient motivation to quit, resources to manage withdrawal symptoms on-site and an ideal ability to
facilitate follow-up with primary care for patients following smoking cessation interventions. Furthermore, it has
its own unique features, separate to provider advice in
other settings that are relevant to intervention, such as the
short window of opportunity to intervene and oftentimes
a lack of an established relationship with the patient. As
such, the inpatient setting provides a unique opportunity
to provide cessation support, to avoid readmission and to
reduce related mortality (Lawson & Flocke, 2009; Mohiuddin, Mooss, & Hunter, 2007).

Tom Sharpe et al.

However, despite its proven effectiveness, various
research studies have revealed low levels of cessation
intervention being carried out by healthcare professionals in the inpatient setting (Berlin, 2008; Katz et al., 2009;
Svavarsdot́tir & Hallgriḿsdot́tir, 2008). While different
studies attribute this lack of engagement with provision
of cessation advice to a variety of factors, no study has
yet systematically reviewed these barriers or placed these
determinants within the context of behaviour change
theory.
We therefore aimed to systematically review studies
which explore the barriers to implementation of smoking
cessation interventions in a hospital inpatient setting. To
provide further insight into these barriers, we report how
often such barriers are reported, and we group the findings according to the COM-B model of behaviour; reflecting ‘Capability’, ‘Motivation’ and ‘Opportunity’ (Michie,
van Stralen, & West, 2011). This approach allows for more
in-depth exploration of the barriers to provision of smoking cessation interventions for hospital inpatients.
Methods
Protocol and registration: The systematic review
was registered with PROSPERO (Protocol number:
42016042499). No protocol was published.
Eligibility Criteria: No restrictions were placed on
study type. Any published research articles that reported
barriers to the provision of smoking cessation advice in
hospital settings were included. The inclusion criteria
were studies based in the hospital inpatient setting, which
detailed barriers to smoking cessation interventions and
which were in English. Studies not in English, based outside of the hospital setting or unavailable as a full-text
document were excluded.
Information sources: On the 4th of January 2017, an
initial search strategy was developed using the databases
OVID MEDLINE, OVID PsycINFO and Cinahl; three online databases. Google Scholar was used to find articles
citing the included studies.
Search: Key words such as ‘physician role’, ‘counselling’, ‘intervention’, ‘smoking cessation’, ‘tobacco use
cessation’, ‘barriers’ and ‘factors’ were used in the search
strategy. Each of these search terms was entered into the
search feature of OVID MEDLINE, OVID PsycINFO and
Cinahl. For example, using OVID MEDLINE’s search engine, ‘physician role’ OR ‘counselling’ OR ‘intervention’
was searched. Then ‘barriers’ OR ‘factors’ was searched.
Last, ‘smoking cessation’ OR ‘tobacco use cessation’ was
searched. To complete our search of this database, the limits from the three searches were entered into the search
engine, using the qualifier ‘AND’. Following this, the results of this final search were transferred to Endnote,
where they were compiled with the search results from
the other two search engines. Any studies that featured
the key terms and were available up to the 4th of January 2017 were included. The final search involved hand
234
https://doi.org/10.1017/jsc.2017.25 Published online by Cambridge University Press

searching the references and citing articles of the included
studies.
Study selection: Studies were identified and compiled
in an Endnote library. Duplicates were removed. Next,
any research articles which did not meet the eligibility criteria according to title were detected and removed. These
included papers not in the English language or those
based outside of the hospital setting. After this, each of
the abstracts was evaluated for relevance to the research
topic.
Data collection process: A full-text copy of each research study was located. Two authors independently reviewed the articles and extracted the information. Any
disagreements were discussed.
Data items: Any item which was reported as a barrier
was recorded.
Risk of bias, summary measures, synthesis and additional analyses were not applicable to the present review.
Results
Figure 1 is the study flowchart. The review yielded 18 research papers for final inclusion.
Table 1 lists an overview of the 18 studies. The studies were carried out between 2001 and 2016 included
hospitals in the US, Canada, England, Australia, Taiwan, Germany, Iceland, Scotland, China and the UAE.
Eleven of the studies concerned nurses, while four studies
specifically interviewed physicians. One study consisted
of data from midwives and two studies assessed assorted
healthcare professionals in the inpatient setting. Methodologies used ranged from self-completed questionnaires
on healthcare worker practices to semi-structured interviews. Twelve studies were quantitative with six qualitative studies.
Table 2 details the 20 barriers found, under the headings of Capability, Opportunity and Motivation, including the number (%) of studies that identify each barrier.
The most common barrier were lack of time (78%
of studies), lack of knowledge (regarding smoking cessation interventions; 56%), perceived lack of motivation
to quit (44%) and lack of support (including from other
colleagues, the hospital and the wider healthcare system;
44%). Barriers reported reflected all three dimensions of
the COM-B model. Seven barriers were reported by less
than 20% of the studies.
Discussion
This is the first systematic review to collate the healthcare
professional reported barriers to the provision of smoking
cessation advice in inpatient settings. Twenty barriers to
smoking cessation interventions were identified in the 18
studies that were found, which reflected each dimension
of the COM-B Model. The most commonly cited barriers were lack of time, knowledge, support and a perceived
lack of patient motivation to quit. The findings are discussed subsequently as per the COM-B model.

Capability

In the area of capability, most studies reported that clinicians lacked knowledge, skills and training to deliver
smoking cessation advice. The most cited barrier was
‘Lack of knowledge’, cited in 56% of studies. The second most cited was a ‘Need for additional training’, cited
in 39% of studies. Indeed, the finding that these attitudes were significantly less likely to provide cessation
advice has repeatedly been shown in previous literature
(Forman, Harris, Lorencatto, McEwen, & Duaso, 2017;
Preechawong, Vathesathogkit, & Suwanratsamee, 2011;
Siddiqi, Dogar, & Siddiqi, 2013). These findings highlight
a clear need for enhancing clinicians’ self-efficacy to deliver such advice. Over a quarter of the publications reviewed acknowledge the problem of a ‘lack of skills’ on the
part of clinical practitioners to effectively promote smoking cessation interventions. This failing in communicative

techniques is also evidenced by prior research on the subject, most notably in a 2013 Cochrane review by Carson
et al., which shows that physicians who are trained in cessation delivery are more likely to use these skills and that
their patients are more likely to quit smoking successfully
(Berland, Whyte, & Maxwell, 1995; Carson et al., 2012).
Interestingly, two separate publications in this review,
acknowledged the negative impact that hospital facilities
themselves can have on intervention effectiveness, encapsulated by the ‘absence of smoke-free hospital campus’ in
the inpatient setting. This concept is supported by previous research regarding patients’ smoking in a smokefree hospital and this particular finding highlights the
necessity of making the inpatient setting a tobacco-free
zone (Rigotti et al., 2000). Overall, these findings not only
match the capability dimension of COM-B, they also provide important evidence that these are subsumed within

Opportunity

Most studies identified that a lack of time, support or resources were barriers to smoking cessation interventions.
The most cited barrier was ‘Lack of time’, cited in 78% of
studies, which was also the most cited barrier overall. The
second most cited was a ‘Lack of support’, cited in 44% of
studies. This perceived absence of adequate intervention
support from colleagues hospital administration or from
primary care physicians, could be seen as a policy issue, to

be addressed. Perceived lack of professional support contributing to an inability to deliver smoking cessation interventions has been identified in previous research and
eight different papers here support this view (Lala, Csikar,
Douglas, & Muarry, 2017). The issue of time constraints
being a leading obstacle to smoking cessation interventions has been well explored in previous literature and
is supported by our findings here (Brotons et al., 2005;
Twardella & Brenner, 2005). However, this review specifically highlights healthcare workers’ difficulty with not
possessing a clear hospital-directed mandate to intervene
in smoking cessation. A heavy or overwhelming workload has been previously described by similar research

It could be argued that a ‘lack of support’, ‘lack of resources’ and ‘absence of mandate to intervene’ are barriers which are similar enough to be grouped as one
heading, such as a ‘lack of structural support’, but given
how frequently each barrier was specifically referenced
throughout the studies in the review, it was decided
to cite each barrier individually, to provide maximum
JOURNAL OF SMOKING CESSATION

Systematic Review of Clinician-Reported Barriers

clarity for healthcare professionals. Similarly, we decided
that the barrier of a ‘heavy or overwhelming workload’
was conceptually different from a ‘lack of time’, as the
three papers, which referenced this barrier, cited it as a
separate issue from the large workload. This allows us
to highlight both of these issues as unique factors which
need to be ameliorated to provide the best possible care
in the inpatient setting.
Motivation

In the COM-B model category of motivation, the most
cited barrier was a clinician-expressed belief in a ‘Lack
of patient motivation’, cited in 44% of studies. This had
been identified by various publications as a substantial
factor to poor provision of smoking cessation interventions and so, it is unsurprising that it was reported in the
papers reviewed (Cabana et al., 1999; McLeod, Somasundaram, Howden-Chapman, & Dowell, 2000; Mohiuddin
et al., 2007; Sarna et al., 2009). This perception stands in
sharp contrast to patient reports and behaviour; in numerous studies, a majority of patients (typically around
70%) want to quit and most are willing to make a quit attempt. Consistent with this, cessation interventions that
use proactive recruitment at the population level typically enrol a large percentage of eligible smokers (Fu et al.,
2014; Meyer et al., 2008; Tzelepis et al., 2011). The second
most cited barrier was a ‘Lack of confidence’, cited in 38%
of studies. This lack of clinical confidence in addressing
patient’s smoking practices is noteworthy as previous research had suggested that healthcare workers were largely
confident and willing to raise the topic of smoking cessation with patients (Sarna, Wewers, Brown, Lillington,
& Brecht, 2001; Sarna et al., 2009; Willaing & Ladelund,
2004). Our review indicates that a large portion of healthcare workers still view themselves as lacking confidence
in addressing this issue. Personal discomfort on the part
of clinicians when broaching the subject of tobacco cessation interventions has been previously identified (Pipe
et al., 2009). One study identified the barrier of smoking being seen as ‘a coping mechanism for patients’ by
healthcare workers, which has been similarly described
in previous literature (Acquavita, Talks, & Fiser, 2017).
Prior research has demonstrated that providing training
to physicians and other healthcare workers substantially
boosts their efficacy, which then translates into improved
cessation intervention delivery (Carson et al., 2012). It is
possible that such attitudes could be addressed at an earlier stage, with students being trained to provide cessation
counselling prior to qualification (Kumar et al., 2017).
This attitude was seen as an altruistic act on the part of
the healthcare professional and is interesting to note as it
strays from the generally accepted view that all tobacco
use, by inpatients, should be ended. These deficits could
be ameliorated through implementation of targeted education and training programmes for healthcare providers.
Not viewing smoking cessation intervention as a priority has been previously reported (Rice, HartmannJOURNAL OF SMOKING CESSATION
https://doi.org/10.1017/jsc.2017.25 Published online by Cambridge University Press

Boyce, & Stead, 2013) with over a quarter of publications
in the present review acknowledging this barrier. This attitude requires examination at a training and educational
level to ensure adequate provision is made to aid patients
in quitting smoking. The potential barrier of insufficient
healthcare worker motivation or interest, which was described by four different publications, also has precedence
in previous research (Borrelli et al., 2001; Hall, Vogt, &
Marteau, 2005). This belief is heavily linked with the reported belief that healthcare workers require financial reward or career recognition to initiate smoking cessation
interventions, which was also identified in four studies in
our review, as a ‘lack of incentive’. This attitude runs contrary to the typically altruistic notion of healthcare workers, but it also has been cited in previous literature, especially in the outpatient setting (Brotons et al., 2005; Fu
et al., 2014). Our review demonstrates that this perceived
insubstantial incentive, for addressing smoking cessation,
is equally present in the inpatient environment, albeit this
may depend on the healthcare system in which professionals are employed.
Four publications reviewed cited, the scepticism
healthcare workers may have regarding smoking cessation intervention effectiveness. This was seen as a tangible
obstacle to delivery of interventions and is another attitudinal belief identified by our review, which is congruent with previous research on the subject (Tong, Strouse,
Hall, Kovac, & Schroeder, 2010). It is interesting to note
that three of the reviewed studies detailed the negative
impact a physician’s own smoking history could have
on the success of cessation intervention. While healthcare worker tobacco use has been reported before (Pipe,
Sorensen, & Reid, 2009), it is interesting that this personal
practice would impact on providing optimal care for patients. A previous research study, in Syria, showed that
physicians who smoke were less likely to deliver cessation
interventions, support non-smoking policies and believe
that smoking was harmful (Asfar, Al-Ali, Ward, Vander
Weg, & Maziak, 2011). This suggests that to increase the
effect this potential barrier has upon future interventions,
healthcare workers should be mindful of not permitting
their own personal tendencies and habits from negatively
affecting patient care.
The one noted instance of ‘social pressure’ being seen
as a barrier to a healthcare worker providing smoking cessation intervention is unusual. Although there is
precedence for it in the literature, it may be specific
to the demographic of male physicians in China, where
these studies were carried out (Cheng, Ernster, & He,
2000; Kohrman, 2004). Future research should investigate
whether this barrier is encountered in other regions.
Finally, three studies expressed the belief that healthcare workers ‘negative past intervention experience’ could
impact the success of smoking cessation interventions.
This viewpoint has been identified by previous research
on the subject (Fu et al., 2014). The fact that such a small
portion of our studies reviewed identified this (17%)
239

Tom Sharpe et al.

suggests that it is perhaps not as pressing a failing as some
of the more common barriers which are categorised under the banner of motivation. Nevertheless, to achieve the
optimum outcomes for smoking cessation interventions,
each of the 20 barriers identified by this review must be
considered as potential areas for improvement, in the inpatient setting.
An interesting point to note is viewing these various studies in the context of self-efficacy to deliver cessation interventions. Several of the barriers identified in the
study detail a failing in healthcare professional efficacy,
such as ‘lack of confidence’, ‘lack of healthcare worker interest or motivation’ and ‘lack of incentive’. Negative past
experiences likely reflect poor efficacy, due to awareness
of one’s lack of expertise and/or lack of success in getting
patients to quit, which makes the physician reluctant to
intervene in the future. For healthcare workers to provide
the optimum care for patients, it is crucial that each identifies the personal efficacy areas, in which they can improve, to correctly deliver clear and effective intervention
advice.
Implications and limitations. These results are not only
useful to practicing healthcare workers, but also for
healthcare managers and educators, as they clearly set
out the areas of inpatient care that could be addressed
through extra training in providing smoking cessation interventions. In contrast to previous research which investigated perceived barriers among physicians (Berlin,
2008) or nurses (Berland et al., 1995; Svavarsdot́tir &
Hallgriḿsdot́tir, 2008; Twardella & Brenner, 2005), this
systematic review identifies barriers synonymous with all
healthcare workers in the inpatient setting, including doctors, nursing staff, caregivers, midwives and counsellors.
However, the limitation inherent in the study design is
that by focusing specifically upon the inpatient setting, it
is not possible to assess the barriers to providing smoking
cessation services in the primary care setting or in community outreach programmes. Notably, similar barriers
have been reported in primary care (Vogt et al., 2005).
Like all systematic literature reviews, this research is also
limited by the quality of the data reviewed. Another limitation is that through utilising the COM-B model, there
may be certain barriers that were outside of the scope
of this paper. One study, by Goldstein et al., details particular efforts in smoking control in the hospital setting
(implementing smoke-free policies in multiple hospitals
and identifying smoking cessation programmes available
to healthcare employees, but its findings are outside of the
framework of the COM-B model and, as such, are unsuitable for inclusion in our results (Goldstein et al., 1992).
A further limitation is that the current analysis does not
provide any weighting to the studies, or indeed, to study
quality. Future work could address these limitations. A
strength of the study is the reporting of barriers within
a behaviour change framework that will guide future interventions. Implementation of smoking cessation inter240

ventions into inpatient settings, accounting for barriers as
reported here, should be a priority.
Conclusion
This review highlights the impediments, attitudes and beliefs that can act as barriers to the provision of smoking
cessation in the hospital inpatient setting. These perceived
barriers range from administrative issues of resource allocation, to clinical practitioners’ ingrained beliefs, to aspects of social and professional discomfort. To address
and ameliorate these barriers to the provision of smoking cessation interventions, changes need to be multidisciplinary and across the spectrum of hospital departments. For example, the time constraints that healthcare
workers described in the review could be best solved at
the managerial level, while patient resistance to treatment
is easier to address in the clinical ward setting. Of the
variety of options for improving hospital management
of tobacco cessation, one suggested solution is the implementation of ‘opt-out’ programmes, which have been
explored in several recent research papers (Faseru et al.,
2017). This practice involves healthcare professionals providing smoking cessation treatment to every tobaccosmoking patient, regardless of their desire to quit. This
practice of offering smoking cessation resources to every
applicable inpatient may help to alleviate the burden on
the cessation barriers identified in this review and further
research studies could investigate this option, while targeting the noted barriers. This systematic review serves to
emphasise the need for further education and training of
healthcare professionals, in the inpatient setting, to maximise the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions
and to minimise the occurrence of tobacco-related disease.

V4: 20 March 2018
The COM-B Theory of Change Model
Note: This is an updated and revised version of the paper posted in 2016.
It reflects more recent experience with the COM-B model, and clarification
of some terms and concepts.
Introduction
Most interventions seek to change the behaviour of individuals and/or
organizations. Yet surprisingly evaluation of interventions has not made much
use of the quite large social research literature on behaviour change theories and
models. One review of that literature is by Darnton (2008).
There are exceptions. Bennett’s hierarchy has been used in the evaluation of
education programs (Bennett 1975; Bennett and Rockwell 1995). The hierarchy
includes an imbedded behaviour change model where by changes in capacity of
knowledge, aspirations, skills and attitudes (KASA) are seen as leading to practice
changes. Steve Montague has used the Bennett hierarchy in a variety of
evaluation settings (Montague 2000; Montague and Valentim 2010; Montague
and Lamers-Bellio 2012).
In a recent article (Mayne 2015), I used the NOA (Needs, Opportunities and
Abilities) model of Gatersleben and Vlek (1998) discussed by Darnton (2008) as
a key part of a useful theory of change model explicitly based on behaviour
change. Darnton’s review of behaviour change models notes a key aspect, namely
that all of the capacity change elements in the models are necessary to bring
about behaviour change. How the capacity change elements are organized and
grouped differ among different models, but are essentially referring to the same
set of capacities. The NAO model argues that needs and opportunities lead to
motivation which when combined with abilities leads to behaviour change.
The COM-B model
In working with the Palladium group, a more recent behaviour change model was
identified that seems even more intuitive and is specifically aimed at
interventions aimed at changing behaviour. This model has also been discussed
on the Better Evaluation web site1. Michie, Stralen and West (2011) set out a
COM-B model of behaviour change: behaviour (B) occurs as the result of
interaction between three necessary conditions, capabilities (C), opportunities
(O) and motivation (M).
Capability is defined as the individual’s psychological and physical
capacity to engage in the activity concerned. It includes having the
1

2
necessary knowledge and skills. Motivation is defined as all those brain
processes that energize and direct behaviour, not just goals and conscious
decision-making. It includes habitual processes, emotional responding, as
well as analytical decision-making. Opportunity is defined as all the
factors that lie outside the individual that make the behaviour possible or
prompt it. (Michie et al. 2011: 4) [italics added]
Their COM-B systems model is shown in Figure 1. Note that both capabilities and
opportunities can influence motivation and all three not only bring about
behaviour change but can also be influenced by the resulting behaviour change,
i.e., there is often a feedback loop from behaviour change to COM change. If
behaviour change seen as limited, then there may be a need for more COM
change work. 2

Reflecting on Bennett’s KASA model:
•
•
•

Capability relates to knowledge and skills, and is similar to abilities.
Opportunity is not in the KASA model (but is in the NAO model).
Motivation relates to attitudes and aspirations.

Many theory of change (ToC) models such as Bennett’s model show enhanced
capacity leading to behaviour change. Here, capacity is the combination of
capabilities, opportunities and motivation.
In a ToC context, for the COM-B model we would have Figure 2. Further
discussion on this type of behaviour-change based ToC model can be found in
Mayne (2015). Key theory of change terms in the model are:
•

2

Outputs are the goods and services provided by the intervention.

More recently, a book on the model has been published: Michie, Atkins and West (2014).

3
•
•

•
•

Assumptions are the salient events and conditions necessary for the
specific causal link to work—for the prior cause to lead to the subsequent
effect. These are causal link assumptions.
External influences are events and conditions unrelated to the
intervention that could contribute to the realization of the intended results.
As such, these other influencing factors could be contributory causes,
explaining in part the observed results.
Supporting activities are actions undertaken by an actor to ensure that the
assumption(s) in question will be realized, i.e., engagement efforts needed
to help ensure the assumptions are brought about.
The enabling environment comprises all those events and conditions
needed to make the ToC work—to enable the ToC. It usually refers to
things beyond the intervention, and hence comprises a subset of the ToC
assumptions.

Interventions typically address building capacity using one or more of capabilities,
opportunities and motivation, indeed often just capabilities such as when
knowledge and skills are enhanced through workshops and training. In such a
case, the capacity change assumptions would have to include an assumption
about adequate opportunities and motivation being in place, since a key
behaviour change model assumption is that the capabilities, opportunities and
motivation are all present and adequate.
Working with the COM-B model
In working with this COM-B generic theory of change model, it is not always clear
how to distinguish among the capacity and behaviour changes and their
associated assumptions. Consider these in turn:
Behaviour Changes
The behaviour changes are the specific practice changes that occur in the target
population. These are usually easy to identify and indeed, to measure.
Behaviour Change Assumptions
Since, based on the model, the ‘right’ capacity change ‘will’ lead to behaviour
change, it is not always clear what the behaviour change assumptions should be
and indeed if any assumptions are needed. A distinction in part could be that
behaviour change often takes time to become ingrained and seen as worthwhile,
and may involve feedback between the behaviour and capacity change. Teaching
skills is fine, but then putting them into practice takes time and no doubt some
trial and error.3
Possible generic behaviour change assumptions therefore could include, the need
for:
•
•
•
•
•

3

Sustained leadership
Other sustained support
Sustained resources
Early successes
Application of new capacities being not too difficult

An alternative indeed would be to include all relevant assumptions as Capacity Change
assumptions. However, it may be useful to include the generic assumptions listed as behaviour
change assumptions to better highlight the need for ongoing support and feedback.

5
Capacity Changes
Capacity changes should be the actual changes acquired in capabilities,
opportunities and motivation. These would often be more of a challenge to
measure and to set targets for. There might be behaviour change research
available that could help.
Of more immediate concern, is understanding exactly what these terms mean in
the COM-B model. The definitions used by Michie et al. (2011) were set out
earlier. They elaborate further:
“Within the three components that generate behaviour, it is possible to develop further
subdivisions that capture important distinctions noted in the research literature. Thus,
•

•

•

With regard to capability, we distinguished between physical and psychological
capability (psychological capability being the capacity to engage in the necessary
thought processes - comprehension, reasoning et al.).
With opportunity, we distinguished between physical opportunity afforded by the
environment and social opportunity afforded by the cultural milieu that dictates the
way that we think about things (e.g., the words and concepts that make up our
language).
With regard to motivation, we distinguished between reflective processes (involving
evaluations and plans) and automatic processes (involving emotions and impulses
that arise from associative learning and/or innate dispositions).” (p. 4)

Stated differently (Michie 2015):
•
•
•

Capability is the psychological and physical ability to enact the behaviour.
Motivation involves the reflective and automatic mechanisms that activate or
inhibit behaviour
Opportunity is the physical and social environment that enables the behaviour.”

Capability is the more straightforward component comprising skills and
knowledge, and frequently addressed in interventions through training and
workshops.
Note though how opportunity is defined. Opportunities include events outside
the individual(s) that make behaviour change possible—including changes in
social norms—or prompt it—such as incentives or sanctions.
Motivation could include new ways of thinking and decision-making. Obviously,
in many cases, new opportunities would trigger enhanced motivation.
Note then that:
• Motivation involve internal processes that have changed such as new
realizations, thinking and forms of decision-making.

Opportunities are external to the individuals and might include reasonable
costs, new or improved markets, changes in social norms, incentives or
penalties for acting.

In a specific intervention, note that not all of changes in capabilities,
opportunities and motivation may need to be addressed. That is, for example,
motivation (such the potential for more income) and capabilities may be there,
but the bottleneck is a lack of opportunity such as supporting social norms in the
case of changing women’s roles or the lack of a working market for a product.
Capacity Change Assumptions
These assumptions need to be the events and conditions that are needed to bring
about the capacity changes. To some extent, the outputs intending to lead to the
capacity change are precisely those events and conditions, or perhaps more likely
the events. But usually more is needed.
Generic capacity change assumptions might be that:
Capabilities
• Training is relevant to the setting
• Messages are understood
• Learning level is appropriate to the audience
• Belief that the capability can be acquired
Opportunity
• Social norms are supportive
• Relevant incentives are supportive
• Needed supports and products are available and affordable
• Individuals have the ability and priority to act
Motivation
• People want to improve their wellbeing
• People want to perform well
•

Reach is realized, if not specifically included.

Further, assumptions for each of changes in capabilities, motivation and
opportunities need to be addressed or accounted for.
Reach and Reaction
Reach and Reaction are the target groups who are expected to receive the
intervention’s outputs and their initial reaction. In an ex post situation, reach
would be those actually reached which could be different from who were expected
to be reached. The expectation Reach would be that those reached saw or were

7
involved with the outputs, such as participating in information learning sessions.
The expected Reaction is that the intervention approach and its outputs were
positively received and deemed worth further consideration.
Reach Assumptions
The assumptions here are the events and conditions needed to occur if the
outputs delivered are to reach and be positively received by the reach groups.
Generic reach assumptions could include such things as
• the targeted audience has the time to participate
• the targeted audience is well defined and can be communicated with,
• the approach and outreach is context sensitive, and
• the goods and services (outputs) appear to be sensible, appropriate and
relevant to the target audience interests.
Some examples
I have redone, using the COM-B model, several of the examples I used in earlier
publications. The first example is the one previously used in Befani and Mayne
(2014) illustrating an intervention to improve girl’s education outcomes, shown
here in Figure 3.

Here the intervention is shown as a composite intervention covering:
• Pathway 1: engagement with community leaders and parents (PW1),
• Pathway 2: improvement to accommodation for girls in schools (PW2),
and
• Pathway 3: gender sensitive training to teachers (PW3).
The explicit use of the COM-B model is evident.

Figure 4 is the nutrition example I used in Mayne (2015). The changes are in the
Capacity and Behaviour Change Assumptions, where the COM components of
capacity change are spelled out.
Types of Behaviour Change Interventions
Michie et al. (2011) also identify a classification of types of interventions and
policies that are used to change behaviour, based on a review of the relevant
literature (p. 7). Table 1 lists the types of interventions they identified. Also noted
in the table is which element of the COM-B model the intervention relates to.
Restructuring the information in Table 1, we have Table 2 showing the types of
interventions associated with each COM-B component. This suggest ways of
bring about capacity changes.

Concluding remarks
The COM-B is an improvement on the previous behaviour change models I have
used in building theories of change. It is more intuitive and more structured,
forcing one to think through the drivers of capacity and behaviour change. In my
experience if you do go through it carefully step-by-step, element-by-element, a
much more solid theory of change will result.
In this note, I have suggested generic types of capacity and behaviour change
assumptions, and Table 2 suggests the types of interventions that can bring about
capability, motivation and opportunity changes.

ABSTRACT
Background
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms,
and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for
achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its
effects.
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term
smoking cessation.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most
recently in April 2022.
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did
not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched
between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition
available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment.
Main results
We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults
either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only

to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison,
which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking.
There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form
(risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I2 = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited
by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I2 = 38%;
5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1
study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour)
patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants).
Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was
moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I2 =
0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants).
High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar longterm quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants).
We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (lowand very low-certainty evidence); or fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence).
Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very
low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low
overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95%
CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg
patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low-certainty evidence).
Authors' conclusions
There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in
an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose
comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products.
Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty
evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed
to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New
studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
What is the best way to use nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking?
Key messages
Using a combination of nicotine patches together with another type of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (such as gum or lozenge) is
more likely to help people quit smoking than if they used one type of NRT alone. We also found that people who smoke have the same
chance of quitting successfully whether they use a nicotine patch or another type of NRT, such as gum, lozenge or nasal spray.
More high-quality studies on different NRT patch doses, durations of NRT use, types of fast-acting NRT, and NRT use prior to quit day are
needed to know which treatments work best to help people quit smoking. These studies should report safety outcomes and withdrawals
due to treatment.
What is nicotine replacement therapy?
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medicine that delivers nicotine to the brain. It is available as skin patches, chewing gum, nasal and
oral sprays, inhalers, lozenges and tablets. The aim of NRT is to replace the nicotine that people who smoke usually get from cigarettes, so
the urge to smoke is reduced and they can stop smoking completely. We know that NRT improves a person's chances of stopping smoking,
and that people use it to quit.
What did we want to find out?
NRT can be taken in many different forms, in different doses and for varying amounts of time. Some people start using NRT before they
quit, while other people wait until quit day. This review looks at the different forms, doses, durations and schedules of NRT used to help
people quit smoking, so we can better understand which of these work best to help people quit smoking for six months or longer. We
also wanted to find out if any of these treatments were associated with cardiac (heart-related) or serious unwanted effects, and if anyone
stopped participating in a study due to the NRT treatment they were advised to use.

What did we do?
We searched for studies that looked at the use of NRT to help people quit smoking and that followed people up for at least six months.
What we found
We found 68 completed studies conducted in 43,327 participants. Most participants were adults who wanted to quit smoking.
Main results
People who smoke have the same chances of quitting successfully whether they use a nicotine patch to quit or another type of NRT, such
as gum, lozenge or nasal spray. Using nicotine patches together with another type of NRT (such as gum or lozenge) made it 17% to 37%
more likely that a person would successfully stop smoking than if they used one type of NRT alone.
People who used higher-dose nicotine patches (25 mg patches worn for 16 hours, or 21 mg patches worn for 24 hours) were more likely to
quit smoking compared to those using lower-dose patches (15 mg patches worn for 16 hours or 14 mg patches worn for 24 hours). However,
there was not any clear evidence to suggest that people using 42 mg or 44 mg patches were more likely to quit than people using 21 mg
or 22 mg (24-hour) patches.
Starting to use NRT before a quit day may help more people to quit than only using it after a quit day, but more evidence is needed to
strengthen this conclusion.
We also looked at how long NRT should be used for, whether NRT should be used on a schedule or on demand as craved, and whether more
people stop smoking when NRT is provided for free versus if they have to pay for it. More research is needed to answer these questions.
Most studies did not look at the safety of NRT. Where studies did look at safety, they found that very few people experienced negative effects.
How reliable are these results?
There is high-certainty evidence that:
- combination NRT works better than a single form of NRT; and
- there is no difference in effect between different types of NRT (such as gum or patch).
This means that future research is very unlikely to change our conclusions. This is because the evidence is based on many participants
and on well-conducted studies.
However, the certainty of the evidence was moderate, low or very low for all the other questions we considered. This means that our
findings may change as new research is carried out. In most cases, this is because there were not enough studies, there were problems
with the design of studies that do exist, and/or these studies were too small.
In terms of the safety of different ways of using NRT, we rated the evidence for this outcome to be of low or very low certainty because
many studies did not report on safety. Large studies covered in a separate review show high-certainty evidence that NRT is safe to use for
quitting smoking.
How up to date is this evidence?
This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.

BACKGROUND
Description of the condition
Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable illness and
death worldwide, killing over eight million people every year (WHO
2022). Most people who smoke want to stop (CDC 2017); however,
quitting tobacco use is difficult. This is due to an interplay of
psychological, physiological, environmental and other factors that
lead to dependence on smoking. The physiological dependence is
caused by a chemical found in tobacco called nicotine (Benowitz
2010; McNeill 2017).

Description of the intervention
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medication formulated in
a variety of ways for absorption through the oral mucosa (chewing
gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhaler/inhalator), nasal mucosa
(spray) or skin (transdermal patches). Nicotine patches are worn on
the body and deliver a nicotine dose slowly and passively through
the skin. They do not replace any of the behavioural aspects of
smoking. In contrast, the other types of NRT mimic some of the
hand-to-mouth actions of smoking, provide an oral substitute, or
do both, and are faster-acting but require more effort on the user's
part. Transdermal patches are available in several different doses.
They deliver between 5 mg to 52.5 mg of nicotine over 24 hours,
resulting in plasma levels similar to the trough levels seen between
cigarettes in heavy smokers (Fiore 1992). Some brands of patch are
designed to be worn for 24 hours, whilst others are to be worn for
16 hours each day. Nicotine gum is available in both 2 mg and 4
mg strengths, and nicotine lozenges are available in 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2
mg and 4 mg strengths. However, the amount of nicotine absorbed
by the user is less than the original dose. The availability of NRT
products on prescription or for over-the-counter purchase varies
from country to country. Table 1 summarises the products currently
licensed in the United Kingdom.

How the intervention might work
The aim of NRT is to replace the nicotine that the person who
smoked tobacco would have been receiving from inhaling the
tobacco smoke, without the harmful elements of tobacco smoke
(McNeill 2017). This should reduce the motivation to smoke
and the physiological and psychomotor withdrawal symptoms
often experienced when smoking is ceased, thereby increasing
the likelihood of remaining abstinent (West 2001). Nicotine
undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, reducing the overall
bioavailability of ingested nicotine. A pill that could reliably
produce high enough nicotine levels in the central nervous system
would risk causing adverse gastrointestinal effects. This is why
NRT was formulated for absorption through the skin or oral/nasal
mucosa.
Cigarette smoking delivers nicotine rapidly, allowing nicotine to act
on the brain within seconds (Benowitz 2010). None of the available
NRT products deliver such high doses of nicotine as efficiently as
cigarettes. The average cigarette delivers between 1 mg and 3 mg
of nicotine. A person who smokes one pack a day absorbs 20 mg
to 40 mg of nicotine daily (Henningfield 2005). However, despite
NRT's relatively slower and lower nicotine delivery, there is highcertainty, well-accepted evidence that NRT helps some people to
stop smoking. A Cochrane Review comparing any NRT product
to control for smoking cessation found a risk ratio (RR) of 1.55
(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.61; 133 studies, 64,640

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

participants; high-certainty evidence), suggesting that the chances
of quitting were increased by 49% to 61% compared to using no
NRT or placebo (Hartmann-Boyce 2018). In addition, many clinical
guidelines recommend NRT as a first-line treatment for people
seeking pharmacological help to stop smoking (Fiore 2008; Italy
ISS 2004; Le Foll 2005; NICE 2022; NZ MoH 2021; Patnode 2021; US
Preventive Services Task Force 2021; West 2000; Woolacott 2002;
Zwar 2011).

Why it is important to do this review
The aforementioned Cochrane Review comparing NRT to control
was first published in 1996 and has been regularly updated since
(Hartmann-Boyce 2018). Despite the number of included studies
more than doubling since its initial publication, the main effect
estimate remained stable. The 2018 review update was therefore
intended to be the final update of the evidence comparing NRT
to placebo or to no pharmacotherapy, as confidence in this effect
estimate is high and unlikely to be changed by further research.
However, many questions about NRT have not been answered.
Evidence comparing different forms, deliveries, doses, durations
and schedules of NRT is still needed, to see whether the
effectiveness of NRT differs when used in different ways, and,
therefore, whether approaches to NRT use can be tailored to
maximise success in achieving long-term abstinence. These factors
are now evaluated separately in this Cochrane Review update.
This is the first update of this Cochrane Review, first published
in 2019 (Lindson 2019). We carried out this update as part of a
wider project to update and synthesise all evidence on licenced
pharmacotherapies and electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation
(Lindson 2022).
Separate Cochrane Reviews compare NRT to other
pharmacotherapies (Livingstone-Banks 2023; Hajizadeh 2023;
Lindson 2022); test the efficacy of NRT in special populations
– including pregnant women (Clair 2020) and adolescents
(Fanshawe 2017) – where we may reasonably hypothesise that
its effectiveness differs from that in the general population; and
test the effectiveness and safety of electronic cigarettes containing
nicotine, which we do not include in this review, but could be
considered a form of NRT (Hartmann-Boyce 2022).

OBJECTIVES
To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms,
deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT), for achieving long-term smoking cessation.

METHODS
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including clusterrandomised trials and quasi-randomised trials (i.e. trials where
treatment allocation was not truly random). Cross-over RCTs
were not eligible for inclusion as this design does not allow
for assessment of longer-term intervention effects on smoking
cessation.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Types of participants

Search methods for identification of studies

We included people of any age who smoked and were motivated to
quit, irrespective of the setting from which they were recruited or
their initial level of nicotine dependence. We included studies that
randomised therapists, rather than people who smoked, provided
that the specific aim of the study was to examine the effect of
different types of NRT use on smoking cessation. We have not
included trials that randomised physicians or other therapists to
receive an educational intervention, which included encouraging
their patients to use NRT, but have reviewed them separately
(Carson 2012).

Electronic searches

Types of interventions
We included any form, dose, duration and schedule of NRT
use (this could include any type of NRT, i.e. gum, transdermal
patches, nasal and oral spray, inhalers and tablets or lozenges).
Eligible comparisons were any other form(s), dose(s), duration(s) or
schedule(s) of NRT use (this could also include any type of NRT).
The terms 'inhaler' and 'inhalator' (an oral device that delivers
nicotine through the mouth by inhalation, for absorption through
the buccal mucosa) are used interchangeably in the literature. We
have used the term 'inhaler' throughout the rest of this review.
Studies were not eligible for inclusion if one of the study arms
received an additional intervention component that could not
be separated from the NRT intervention, making it impossible to
establish whether any effect found was a result of the difference
in NRT use or the additional component. We did not include
studies that evaluated the effect of NRT for individuals who were
attempting to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked rather than
quit. A separate review of harm reduction approaches covers this
type of study (Lindson-Hawley 2016).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1) Smoking cessation. This review evaluates the effects of different
NRT regimens on smoking cessation. We therefore excluded trials
that did not assess smoking cessation as an outcome, and also
those that followed participants for fewer than six months, in line
with the standard methods of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction
Group. For each study, we chose the strictest available criteria
to define abstinence. For example, in studies where biochemical
validation of cessation was available, only those participants
who met the criteria for biochemically-confirmed abstinence were
regarded as being abstinent. Wherever possible, we chose a
measure of sustained cessation rather than point prevalence. We
regard people who were lost to follow-up as being continuing
smokers (West 2005).
2) Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Number
of participants reporting cardiac AEs (as defined by study authors,
but including: fast or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, myocardial
infarction or stroke), any SAEs, and withdrawing due to effects of
the treatment where they were reported. We report cardiac AEs
rather than AEs in general, as NRT is generally deemed to be safe,
but cardiac AEs have been identified as a particular area of concern
(Hartmann-Boyce 2018). We did not exclude studies if they did not
report AEs.

We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group (via Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS)-Web) on
29 April 2022 for any reports of trials referring to the use of NRT of
any type by searching for 'NRT', or 'nicotine' near terms for nicotine
replacement products in the title, abstract or keywords. The most
recent issues of the databases included in the register as searched
for the current update of this review were:
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL; 2022,
Issue 3);
• MEDLINE (via Ovid) to update 20220405;
• Embase (via Ovid) to week 202214;
• PsycINFO (via Ovid) to update 20220404.
The search strategy for the Register is given in Appendix 1.
Searches for the Register are not restricted by date, language
or format of publication. The Cochrane Tobacco Addiction
Group's website provides details on the searches used to create
the specialised register (see: tobacco.cochrane.org/resources/
cochrane-tag-specialised-register). The trials register also includes
trials identified by handsearching abstract books from meetings of
the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.
For previous versions of the original review, we searched additional
databases: CancerLit, Health Planning and Administration, Social
SciSearch, Smoking & Health and Dissertation Abstracts. Since the
searches did not produce additional trials, we did not search these
databases after December 1996.
Searching other resources
Our searches of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction
Specialised Register also covered records in ClinicalTrials.gov
(clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), as these are indexed in
CENTRAL. During preparation of the first version of the original
review (Silagy 1996), we also sent letters to manufacturers of NRT
preparations. Since this did not result in additional data, we have
not repeated the exercise for subsequent updates.

Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
In previous versions of the original review (Silagy 1996; Silagy
2001; Silagy 2002; Silagy 2004; Stead 2008), one review author
screened records retrieved by searches, to exclude papers that
were not reports of potentially relevant studies. For the last
three updates (Stead 2012, Lindson 2019, and this version), two
people independently screened references to establish eligibility.
We screened references in two stages. First, two review authors (for
this update: AT, NL, SCC, JLB, AH) screened titles and abstracts for
eligibility. For those that appeared to be eligible or where eligibility
was still unclear, we retrieved full-text papers. Two review authors
(for this update: AT, NL, AH, JLB) then went on to independently
screen each report for eligibility. Where there were disagreements
on eligibility between the two review authors, a third review author
was asked to screen the studies. We did not exclude studies based
on the language of publication.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Measures of treatment effect
Smoking cessation

Two people (from: AT, SCC, WY, AR) independently extracted
data from the published reports and abstracts. We resolved
disagreements by discussion or referral to a third review author
(NL). We made no attempt to blind these individuals either to the
results of the primary studies or to which treatment participants
received. We examined non-English language reports with the
assistance of translators.

We extracted smoking cessation rates in the intervention and
control groups from the reports at six or 12 months. Since not
all studies reported cessation rates at exactly these intervals, we
allowed a window of six weeks at each follow-up point. For trials
without 12-month follow-up, we used six-month data. For trials
that also reported follow-up at more than a year, we used 12-month
outcomes in most cases (we note the length of follow-up for each
study in the Characteristics of included studies table). Where both
validated and self-reported quit rates were reported, we used the
validated rates to calculate the study treatment effect. However,
where only self-reported data were available, we used these to
calculate the treatment effect.

We extracted the following data from each study where available.

Adverse events and serious adverse events

Data extraction and management

• Study characteristics: references, study registration details,
country, funder, author conflicts of interest, design, including
unit of randomisation.
• Recruitment methods: setting, eligibility criteria.
• Participant characteristics: number randomised, gender,
baseline measures, such as cigarettes per day, any measure of
levels of dependence (such as the Fagerström Test for Cigarette
Dependence (FTCD; Fagerström 2012)).
• Intervention and comparator details: type of NRT, dosage,
schedule of use, other details on methods.
• Common behavioural support/intervention: mode of delivery,
number of sessions, length of support sessions, any other
available information.
• Smoking abstinence outcome: definition of abstinence used,
whether biochemical validation took place and how this was
defined, number abstinent in each arm, number randomised to
each arm, attrition rates.
• AE/SAE outcome: whether AEs/SAEs were measured, when they
were measured, number of participants reporting a cardiac AE
in each arm, number of participants reporting a serious AE in
each arm, number of withdrawals in each arm due to allocated
treatment.
• Risk of bias: information related to any of the risk of bias
domains outlined below; information related to any other
potential biases identified.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed included studies for risks of selection bias (methods
of randomised sequence generation and allocation concealment),
performance and detection bias (the presence or absence of
blinding), attrition bias (levels and reporting of loss to follow-up),
and any other threats to study quality, using the Cochrane risk of
bias tool. For each new study in this update, two review authors
(from: AT, SCC, WY) independently assessed each study for each
domain, in accordance with risk of bias guidance developed by the
Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group to assess smoking cessation
studies. Where there was any disagreement on the assessment, a
third review author (NL) acted as arbiter.

We extracted information on whether AEs were measured, at
what time points they were measured, the number of participants
reporting a cardiac AE in each arm, the number of participants
reporting an SAE in each arm (using the definitions provided by
study authors), and the number of withdrawals in each arm due to
allocated treatment.
Following the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's recommended
method of data analysis for dichotomous outcomes, we used the
risk ratio (RR) to summarise all the individual trial outcomes where
this was possible. Whilst there are circumstances in which odds
ratios (ORs) may be preferable, there is a danger that they will be
interpreted as if they are RRs, making the treatment effect seem
larger (Deeks 2017).
Unit of analysis issues
We planned to include any studies that randomised participants
in clusters (i.e. cluster-RCTs), as well as those that individually
randomised participants. However, none of our included studies
were cluster-randomised. A number of studies appear in multiple
subgroup analyses. The reasons for this and how the analyses were
subsequently managed are outlined in the forest plot footnotes:
(1) not pooling the meta-analysis; (2) splitting the number of
participants in certain study arms to avoid double-counting when
pooling subgroups.
Dealing with missing data
We treated participants who dropped out or who were lost to
follow-up after randomisation as being continuing smokers. We
note losses to follow-up in the risk of bias table, and whether
there was high or differential loss to follow-up. The assumption
that 'missing = smoking' gives conservative absolute quit rates,
and will make little difference to the RR unless dropout rates differ
substantially between groups.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity, to
establish how studies should be grouped and where it was
appropriate to pool studies. To assess heterogeneity statistically,
we used the I2 statistic, given by the formula [(Q - df)/Q] x 100%,
where Q is the Chi2 statistic and df is its degrees of freedom (Higgins
2003). This describes the percentage of the variability in effect
estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than to sampling error

(chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered to indicate
substantial heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
Reporting bias is best assessed using funnel plots, where 10 or more
RCTs contribute to an outcome (Higgins 2011). Therefore, where
a meta-analysis included 10 or more studies, we generated and
reported on a funnel plot.
Data synthesis
Following assessment of clinical heterogeneity, we separated
studies into the following groups testing different NRT comparisons
(based on types/uses of NRT).
• Patch therapy
◦ Patch dose
◦ Duration of patch therapy
◦ Effect of tapering patch dose
• Combination therapy
◦ Combination versus single form
◦ Duration of combination therapy
• Fast-acting NRT versus patch
• Fast-acting NRT
◦ Type of fast-acting NRT
◦ Nicotine gum dose and duration
◦ Fixed versus 'ad lib' dosing schedule (ad libitum or 'ad lib'
means as much and as often as desired)
• NRT preloading versus standard post-quit use
• Costs
◦ Free versus purchased NRT
◦ Duration of free NRT
Studies were eligible to fall within more than one comparison.
Smoking cessation
Within these groups, we estimated pooled weighted averages using
the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method to generate risk ratios
(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where appropriate. We
chose a priori to use a fixed-effect method, as we assumed that
there would be minimal heterogeneity in the true effect due to
the nature of the intervention. Where only one study tested a
comparison, we report this narratively.
Adverse events
Within the groups above, we conducted three analyses where the
relevant data were available. We estimated a pooled weighted
average using Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect methods comparing the
number of cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to effects of
the treatment, reported between trial arms. We generated effect
estimates as the RR and 95% CI where appropriate.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We split the following comparisons into subgroups, to investigate
whether variations between intervention characteristics resulted in
varied effects.
• Patch dose: studies split according to the dosage administered;
namely, 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg and 21/25 mg versus 14/15
mg.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Duration of patch therapy: studies split according to duration of
treatment. This ranged from two weeks to 52 weeks.
• Combination versus single-form therapy: studies split by type of
combination NRT used (e.g. patch plus gum, patch plus nasal
spray, etc.) and type of single NRT used (e.g. patch alone, fastacting NRT alone, choice of single-form NRT, etc.).
• Duration of combination therapy: studies split according to
duration of treatment. This ranged from two weeks to 16 weeks.
• Fast-acting NRT versus patch: studies split by type of fast-acting
NRT used.
• Type of fast-acting NRT: studies split by type of fast-acting NRT
used in either comparison group.
• 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum: participants split into highversus low-dependency smokers, as defined by study authors.
• Fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule: studies split by the type of
NRT used; namely, gum or nasal spray.
• NRT preloading versus standard post-quit use: studies split by
the type of NRT used (e.g. patch, gum, patch and gum).
• Free versus purchased NRT: studies split by the type of NRT used;
namely, patch or gum.
• Duration of free NRT: studies split by length of period free NRT
provided. This ranged from one week to eight weeks.
Sensitivity analysis
We carried out the following sensitivity analyses.
• We tested the impact of removing any study judged at high risk
of bias for any domain on the relevant meta-analyses.
• In Walker 2011, a very low proportion of participants who
claimed to have quit completed verification (34%). We extracted
actual verified rates and used these in our main analysis. We
conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing these figures to
data extrapolated from these proportions to the wider trial
population and non-verified rates.
• We tested, post hoc, the impact of removing studies focussed
on specific populations that may be considered vulnerable (e.g.
adolescents, people with alcohol use disorder, people with
psychiatric disorders).
Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence
Following standard Cochrane methodology, we created summary
of findings tables for the following comparisons, which we deemed
to be most clinically relevant:

•

duration of combination therapy;

Also, following standard Cochrane methodology (Higgins 2011;
Higgins 2022), we used the five GRADE considerations (study
limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and
publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for
smoking cessation, SAEs and treatment withdrawals, and to draw

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Included studies
This review update includes a total of 68 studies (159 references)
involving 43,327 participants; five studies are new to this update
(Berlin 2011; Dignan 2019; Garvey 2006; LeBlanc 2017; Leung
2019), whilst the remaining 63 were included in the previous
review (Lindson 2019). Studies were conducted in the USA (41
studies), Europe (15 studies), Australasia (four studies), Canada
(two studies), China (two studies), South Africa (two studies), South
America (one study) and across multiple continents (one study).
The sample size per study ranged from 45 to 3575 participants, with
a median of 401. See Characteristics of included studies for further
details.

•

Participants
Participants were typically adults who smoke, with an average age
of approximately 44. Seven studies targeted specific populations:
Moolchan 2005 recruited adolescents;
Hall 2009 recruited participants over 50 years of age;
Kornitzer 1987 recruited only men in a workplace setting;
Cooney 2009 recruited participants who were alcoholdependent at the time of the study;
• Kalman 2006 recruited people with a history of alcohol
dependence;
• Dennis 2016 recruited adults who smoked diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD);
• Berlin 2011 recruited people who smoked with "...either a
known smoking-related disorder or an underlying disease with
increased risk for smoking-related illnesses."

•

•
•
•
•

•

The average number of cigarettes smoked was greater than or equal
to 20 per day in most studies (48 of the 61 trials (79%)). Killen
1999 recruited only people smoking 25 or more cigarettes a day,
and Hughes 1999 recruited only people smoking 30 or more a
day. Seven studies did not report participants' average number of
cigarettes per day.
Thirty-two studies recruited participants directly from the
community, making it the most common source of
recruitment. Most participants volunteered in response to media
advertisements, with one study using advertisements on internet
sites (Hughes 2018). A number of studies recruited participants
through referrals from clinicians or healthcare clinics, such as
smoking cessation clinics or quit-lines, substance abuse clinics, or
primary care clinics, and one study recruited from referrals to a lung
health clinic (Tønnesen 2000). Two studies recruited participants
from previous smoking-cessation studies (Baker 2016; Tønnesen
1996), two from worksites (Kornitzer 1987; Kornitzer 1995), and
one from universities (Schnoll 2015). Some studies used a mixture
of these approaches or did not report how participants were
recruited.
Types and uses of nicotine replacement therapy
Studies addressed a range of questions relating to the effectiveness
of different types and uses of NRT. The variations on NRT use tested
are listed below (some studies tested more than one NRT variant):
• Patch dose (10 studies): three studies compared 25 mg to 15
mg (16-hour) patches (CEASE 1999; Killen 1999; Paoletti 1996);
one study compared 21 mg to 14 mg (24-hour) patches (TNSG

•

1991); two studies compared 42 mg and 21 mg (24-hour) patches
(Kalman 2006; Rose 2010); and one study compared 44 mg to
22 mg (24-hour) patches (Jorenby 1995). Dale 1995 and Hughes
1999 both compared three different doses: 44 mg versus 22 mg
versus 11 mg (24-hour), and 42 mg versus 35 mg versus 21 mg
(24-hour), respectively. Garvey 2006 randomised people to five
nicotine patch treatment conditions: placebo, 21 mg, 42 mg, or a
tailored dose at either 50% or 100% nicotine replacement based
on smoking history.
24-hours-a-day versus 16-hours-a-day patch use (one study):
one study included a direct comparison between groups
wearing the same nicotine patches (dose and delivery system
not specified) over either 16 hours (removing the patch at
bedtime) or 24 hours (continuous use, including overnight)
(Daughton 1991). All participants used patches for four weeks
after the quit day.
Duration of patch therapy (seven studies): Schnoll
2015 compared 52-week use of nicotine patches to 24-week
use and 8-week use. CEASE 1999 compared 28-week with 12week use, and Schnoll 2010a compared 24-week with 8-week
use. Bolin 1999 and Hilleman 1994 both compared 12-week
patch use to shorter patch use, i.e. six weeks and three weeks,
respectively. Cummings 2011 compared 6-, 4- and 2-week use
and Glavas 2003 compared 6-week and 3-week patch use.
Effect of tapering patch dose (two studies): these studies
compared the effect of stopping patch use abruptly at a
high dose to gradually reducing patch dose over a prolonged
time. Hilleman 1994 did this by providing one group of
participants with 21 mg patches for six weeks and providing
another group of participants with 21 mg patches for four weeks,
then 14 mg patches for four weeks, then 7 mg patches for
another four weeks. Stapleton 1995 gave all participants a 15 mg
patch for one week; then participants could choose to receive
either a continued 15 mg dose or a higher 35 mg dose for a
further 11 weeks. Participants were randomised within these
self-selected groups to either taper their patch dose after the
12 weeks or to receive tapered placebo patches. Participants in
the active patch group, therefore, received a further two-week
dose of 15 mg patches, followed by two weeks of 10 mg patches,
followed by two weeks of 5 mg patches. The placebo group
received the equivalent placebo patches.
Combination versus single form (16 studies): combination
NRT usually describes using nicotine patches and a fastacting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge. Cooney
2009, Kornitzer 1995, Leung 2019, Puska 1995 and Smith
2013 all studied patch in combination with nicotine gum. Puska
1995 compared combination therapy to gum alone, whereas
the other studies compared combination therapy to patch
alone. Blondal 1999 and Croghan 2003 combined patch
with nasal spray. Blondal 1999 used patch alone as the
comparator, whereas Croghan 2003 had a group of participants
that received patch alone and a group that received nasal
spray alone. Bohadana 2000, Caldwell 2016 and Tønnesen
2000 combined patches with inhaler; Caldwell 2016 compared
to patch alone, Bohadana 2000 to inhaler alone, and Tønnesen
2000 compared to both patch alone and inhaler alone. Baker
2016, Krupski 2016, Piper 2009 and Smith 2009 all used
patch in combination with lozenge. Baker 2016 and Krupski
2016 compared combination NRT to patch alone, whereas
both Piper 2009 and Smith 2009 compared combination
NRT to a group receiving patch only and a group receiving

lozenge only. Caldwell 2014 combined patch with oral spray
and compared this to patch use alone. Finally, Dignan
2019 (incomplete factorial design) compared the choice of one
NRT product with choice of two NRT products (patch or gum
or lozenge); we assumed that patch was likely selected when
used in combination with a choice of fast-acting NRT (gum or
lozenge), as this is in-line with common practice.
Duration of combination therapy (three studies): these studies
investigated the optimum length of combination patch
plus gum use. Smith 2013 compared 6-week to 2-week
use, Piper 2016 compared 16-week to 8-week use, and Schlam
2016 compared 26-week to 8-week use.
Fast-acting NRT versus patch (eight studies): fast-acting NRT
refers to the faster-acting (non-patch) formulations of NRT, such
as gum, lozenge, nasal spray, and so on. One study compared
patch to inhaler (Tønnesen 2000), two studies compared patch
to nasal spray (Croghan 2003; Lerman 2004), three studies
compared patch to lozenge (Piper 2009; Schnoll 2010b; Smith
2009), and two studies compared patch to gum (Kupecz 1996;
Moolchan 2005).
Type of fast-acting NRT (one study): only Bolliger 2007 compared
the effectiveness of different forms of fast-acting NRT by
comparing oral spray to gum to inhaler.
Nicotine gum dose (five studies): these studies compared 4 mg
nicotine gum to 2 mg nicotine gum (Garvey 2000; Herrera 1995;
Hughes 1990; Kornitzer 1987; Tønnesen 1988).
Duration of gum use (one study): Hall 2009 investigated whether
the duration of gum use affected quit rates. The intervention
group used gum for 50 weeks and the comparison group used
gum for 10 weeks.
Fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule (four studies): these
studies investigated whether instructions on when to use fastacting NRT influenced effectiveness. Goldstein 1989 and Killen
1990 provided participants with 2 mg nicotine gum; Rey
2009 and Tønnesen 1996 provided participants with nasal spray.
The fixed-dosing groups were either asked to use one piece/
puff per hour (Goldstein 1989; Killen 1990; Tønnesen 1996), or
two puffs per hour (Rey 2009), regardless of cravings. The ad lib
dosing groups were all asked to use their product when a craving
occurred, with a maximum upper limit for daily use, i.e. 30 pieces
of gum a day or 80 puffs of nasal spray.
NRT preloading versus standard post-quit NRT use (nine
studies): traditionally, NRT is used from a quit date onward,
after tobacco use has ceased. NRT preloading is when NRT is
used before the quit day, whilst the participant is still smoking.
Seven studies provided participants with nicotine patches prequit day (Dennis 2016; Preloading Investigators 2018; Rose 1994;
Rose 1998; Rose 2006; Rose 2009; Schuurmans 2004), and two
studies included participants that used patch alone, gum alone
and patch plus gum pre-quit day (Bullen 2010; Piper 2016). The
length of nicotine preloading also varied across studies. Seven
studies initiated NRT use two weeks before the quit date (Bullen
2010; Dennis 2016; Rose 1994; Rose 1998; Rose 2006; Rose 2009;
Schuurmans 2004), one initiated use three weeks before the
quit date (Piper 2016), and one initiated use four weeks before
the quit date (Preloading Investigators 2018). Following the quit
date, all study arms received active NRT.
Stopping patch use versus continuing patch use on relapsing
(one study): Hughes 2018 tested whether the instruction to stop
using a nicotine patch in the event of a smoking lapse resulted in

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

different quit rates to the instruction to continue using a patch
in the event of a lapse, in participants who were using nicotine
patches after a quit day.
• Free versus purchased NRT (two studies): these studies
investigated whether buying NRT versus being provided with
NRT free of charge resulted in different quit rates. Hughes
1991 had three study arms that all used nicotine gum.
Participants were randomised to: 1) a free prescription for six
months; 2) buying the gum for USD 6 per box; 3) buying the
gum for USD 20 per box. Hays 1999 also randomised participants
to three groups: 1) nicotine patches provided free of charge; 2)
placebo patches provided free of charge; 3) nicotine patches
bought by participants. The placebo patch group is excluded
from this review.
• Duration of free NRT (two studies): these studies provided
participants with NRT free of charge for a limited period
of the study, then encouraged participants to source the
remainder of the treatment themselves. The length of free NRT
varied between trial arms. Abdullah 2013 provided two weeks
of free patch or gum (depending on participant preference)
in one arm and one week free in the other arm. In both
arms, participants were encouraged to use NRT for a total of
eight to 12 weeks, sourcing the remainder themselves. Burns
2016 provided participants with eight weeks of nicotine patches
in one arm and four weeks in another arm. Participants were
encouraged to use patches for a total of 10 weeks and to source
the remainder themselves.
In addition to the comparisons above, Walker 2011 provided
participants with a 1-week free NRT selection box (including one
patch, gum, inhaler, sublingual tablets and oral pouches), followed
by eight weeks of free participant-selected NRT in the intervention
arm. The comparison arm received eight weeks of subsidised NRT
patches or gum. Tulloch 2016 provided one group of participants
with nicotine patches for 10 weeks, beginning on the quit day.
Participants were provided with a maximum dose of 21 mg or
14 mg, depending on their baseline cigarettes per day. Dosage
was then tapered from weeks seven to 10. Another group of
participants self-titrated their nicotine patch dosage to a maximum
of 35 mg, and also used ad libitum nicotine gum or inhaler for
up to 22 weeks. LeBlanc 2017 compared a control group receiving
10 weeks of declining, standard dose (not specified) nicotine
patch to 10 weeks of nicotine patch, titrated based on smoking
history combined with a nicotine inhaler, used ad libitum. Berlin
2011 provided one group of participants with a nicotine dose aimed
at substituting 100% (± 5%) of their nicotine prescribed based
on the previous week's saliva cotinine concentrations. This group
was compared to standard care in which participants received
nicotine doses mixed based on dependence. Nicotine doses were
delivered via nicotine patch, in addition to gum or lozenge, at the
investigators' discretion.
Excluded studies
We listed the reasons for excluding 51 studies (63 references) that
were potentially relevant in Characteristics of excluded studies. For
this update, we excluded most studies at full-text screening stage
because they had an ineligible comparator; for example, placebo
rather than another form of NRT. A separate Cochrane Review
assesses this type of study (Hartmann-Boyce 2018).

Ongoing studies
We found four ongoing studies as part of this updated search which
may be relevant for inclusion when complete.
• NCT03538938: a four-factor factorial design with 16 treatment
combinations. Factors included: (1) 1-call versus 4-call quit-line
counselling; (2) nicotine patch versus patch plus lozenge; (3)
enroled versus informed about smokefreeTXT (an 'evidencebased smoking cessation texting support program'); (4)
financial incentives versus no financial incentives for treatment
engagement.
• NCT03611881: a three-factor factorial design with eight
treatment combinations. Factors included: (1) 4-week versus
8-week behavioural counselling; (2) 2-week versus 8-week
nicotine patch; (3) no referral versus counsellor-facilitated
referral to a community-based programme to address social
needs.
• NCT04188873: a four-factor factorial design with 16 treatment
combinations. Factors included: (1) varenicline versus

combination NRT; (2) 4-week versus standard preparation
medication; (3) 12-week versus 24-week medication duration;
(4) minimal versus intensive counselling.
• Zawertailo 2020: will compare a daily 21 mg nicotine patch
plus placebo patch to a daily 21 mg nicotine patch plus
additional patch at a dose based on tolerability and number
of cigarettes per day in the preceding week. Both groups will
receive treatment for five weeks of titration and five weeks of
maintenance, then tapering down by 7 mg/week.
Further details are summarised in Characteristics of ongoing
studies.

Risk of bias in included studies
Overall, we judged nine studies to be at low risk of bias (low risk of
bias across all domains), 28 at high risk of bias (high risk of bias in
at least one domain), and the remaining 31 at unclear risk of bias. A
summary illustration of the risk of bias profile across trials is shown
in Figure 2.

Allocation

Incomplete outcome data

We assessed selection bias through investigating methods of
random sequence generation and allocation concealment for each
study. We rated 30 studies at low risk of bias for random sequence
generation, 37 at unclear risk and one at high risk (Kupecz 1996). We
judged Kupecz 1996 to be at high risk as it was described as 'quasiexperimental', with month of recruitment randomised to study arm
(gum or patch), and all people recruited in each month provided
with the allotted treatment. We judged 28 studies to be at low risk
for allocation concealment and 40 at unclear risk.
When assessing both random sequence generation and allocation
concealment, an unclear risk of bias resulted from insufficient
information about methods used in studies, making it impossible
to be sure whether bias was present or not.

We judged studies to be at low risk of attrition bias where the
numbers of participants lost to follow-up were clearly reported,
the overall number lost to follow-up was not more than 50%, and
the difference in loss to follow-up between groups was no greater
than 20%. This is in accordance with risk of bias guidance produced
by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group for assessing smoking
cessation studies. We found that 39 of the studies were at low risk
of bias, 22 were at unclear risk and seven were at high risk. In six of
the seven studies at high risk (Caldwell 2014; Dennis 2016; Dignan
2019; Krupski 2016; Leung 2019; Rose 2009), this was because
overall loss to follow-up was more than 50%. The rating of high risk
in Hughes 1999 was because the study was terminated early by the
sponsor, resulting in incomplete long-term follow-up data; losses
were included in the analysis as non-abstinent.

Blinding

Effects of interventions

We assessed any risk of bias linked to blinding as one domain.
However, we took into account both performance and detection
bias when making this judgement. Although we are assessing a
pharmaceutical treatment (NRT) in this review, there were some
circumstances where the variation in treatment between arms
meant it would be impossible to blind participants and study
personnel by using a placebo. For example, in Abdullah 2013,
the intervention being tested was the length of time NRT was
supplied to participants for free (overall length of NRT use was the
same). In such cases, we did not rate studies at high risk as long
as participants received similar amounts of face-to-face contact
between groups, abstinence was biochemically verified, or both.
We judged 21 studies to be at low risk of bias for this domain, 23 at
unclear risk and 24 at high risk.

Dose

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

notably very small (seven in the higher-dose arms and one in the
lower-dose arms).

See Summary of findings 3. We treated three groups of studies that
compared different patch doses as separate groups for our first
comparison: group 1: 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg patches; group 2:
25 mg versus 15 mg patches; group 3: 21 mg versus 14 mg patches.
Although the doses included in groups 2 and 3 appear comparable,
the patches used in these groups did not have comparable delivery
systems, meaning the doses delivered to participants per hour
were likely to be different across the two groups. The three studies
comparing the 25 mg dose to the 15 mg dose all used patches
that delivered nicotine over a 16-hour period (to be worn during
waking hours) (CEASE 1999; Killen 1999; Paoletti 1996), so the
doses delivered per hour were approximately 1.6 mg and 0.9 mg.
However, in TNSG 1991, which compared a 21 mg dose with a
14 mg dose, the patches used delivered nicotine over 24 hours
(to be worn continuously, including overnight), resulting in doses
of approximately 0.9 mg and 0.6 mg per hour. The five studies
comparing 42/44 mg doses with 21/22 mg doses all used patches
that delivered nicotine over 24 hours (Dale 1995; Hughes 1999;
Jorenby 1995; Kalman 2006; Rose 2010), so the approximate doses
delivered per hour were 1.8 mg and 0.9 mg, respectively.

When we compared 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches,
we found a difference in study withdrawals due to treatment,
with more withdrawals occurring in participants receiving higherdose patches and CIs excluding no difference (RR 4.99, 95% CI
1.60 to 15.50; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; Analysis 1.5).
However, when we compared 21 mg to 14 mg (24-hour) patches,
the evidence was inconclusive (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.64; 1 study,
537 participants; Analysis 1.5). Two additional studies reported
treatment withdrawals overall rather than by trial arm: CEASE
1999 reported that 2% of participants withdrew overall and Rose
2010 reported 3% overall.

When we compared 21 mg to 14 mg (24-hour) patches, we found
an effect on smoking cessation in favour of the higher dose, with
confidence intervals (CIs) excluding no difference (risk ratio (RR)
1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants; Analysis 1.1).
When we compared 25 mg to 15 mg (16-hour) patches, the point
estimate was in favour of the higher dose; however, the lower limit
of the CI was one (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I2 = 0%; 3 studies,
3446 participants). Finally, when we compared 42 mg or 44 mg to
21 mg or 22 mg (24-hour) patches, the point estimate was lower,
and CIs included the possibility of no difference and of favouring the
lower dose (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I2 = 38%; 5 studies, 1655
participants). Results were not sensitive to the exclusion of one
study at a high risk of bias or the removal of the Kalman 2006 study,
which focused on a specific population of people with alcohol use
disorder (we conducted the latter sensitivity analysis post hoc).

Duration

When we compared high- (25 mg) and low-dose (15 mg) 16hour patches, evidence was inconclusive and CIs included the
possibility of higher, lower and no difference in the risk of fast
or irregular heartbeat (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.33; I2 = 0%; 2
studies, 3269 participants; Analysis 1.2) or myocardial infarctions
(RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.51; 1 study, 2861 participants; Analysis
1.3) when the higher dose was used. Only two of nine studies
reported cardiac adverse events (AEs) by trial arm (CEASE 1999;
Killen 1999). Hughes 1999 reported that 8% of the 42 mg (24-hour)
patch group experienced cardiac side effects but did not report data
for the other treatment arms, so could not be included in the metaanalysis.
Three studies comparing patch doses collected data on overall
serious adverse effects (SAEs); however, only two studies reported
events and contributed to the pooled effect estimate (Hughes
1999; Jorenby 1995; TNSG 1991). This pooled estimate showed
an increased number of events in the higher-dose arm but with
wide CIs incorporating no difference as well as potentially favouring
the lower-dose (RR 5.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 28.82; I2 = 0%; 3 studies,
1560 participants; Analysis 1.4). The overall number of events was

A final study randomised people to five nicotine-patch treatment
conditions (placebo, 21 mg, 42 mg, or a tailored dose at either
50% or 100% nicotine replacement based on smoking history)
(Garvey 2006). The authors concluded that individualising 100%
replacement of nicotine based on smoking history was not more
efficacious than standard patch treatment in moderately- to
heavily-dependent people who smoked; however, findings of other
relevant comparisons were not reported.

See Summary of findings 4. None of the comparisons based on
duration of patch therapy showed evidence of a difference for
smoking cessation (Analysis 2.1), SAEs (Analysis 2.2) or treatment
withdrawal (Analysis 2.3). Studies were so clinically heterogenous
that we did not pool across subgroups. For individual subgroups,
the number of included studies was small, and CIs were generally
wide, meaning we cannot rule out a clinically significant difference
or conduct sensitivity analyses.
In terms of safety, four studies comparing different durations of
patch therapy reported cardiac AEs (CEASE 1999; Glavas 2003;
Schnoll 2010a; Schnoll 2015). However, meta-analysis was not
possible due to a lack of reporting of events by the duration
of treatment (CEASE 1999), measuring AEs for different lengths
of time by treatment arm (Glavas 2003), and not reporting AEs
cumulatively across time points (Schnoll 2010a; Schnoll 2015).
However, Glavas 2003 reported no cardiac AEs in either the 3- or 6week NRT groups during the time participants were on treatment.
Cardiac AEs were also rare and similar between trial arms in Schnoll
2010a and Schnoll 2015 (see Appendix 2).
Effect of tapering
Neither of the two studies that compared the tapering of patch
dose before end of treatment to abrupt withdrawal indicated any
difference in effect on smoking cessation, but CIs are wide and there
was imprecision around this estimate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.32;
I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 264 participants; Analysis 3.1). Results were not
sensitive to removing the one study at a high risk of bias.
Neither of the studies reported cardiac AEs or SAEs. Hilleman
1994 found no clear evidence of a difference between tapering and
abrupt withdrawal on withdrawals due to treatment (RR 0.90, 95%
CI 0.35 to 2.35; 1 study, 140 participants; Analysis 3.2). Stapleton
1995 reported 2% treatment withdrawals but did not report these
by trial arm and so could not be included in the meta-analysis.

Other variations in patch use
Two final studies tested the effects of other variations in patch use
(Daughton 1991; Hughes 2018). These studies did not fall under the
headings above and we did not enter them into a meta-analysis.
• Daughton 1991 looked at the effect of using the same nicotine
patches (nicotine dose and delivery system not specified) for
24 hours a day versus 16 hours a day (in the former group,
participants wore patches overnight, and in the latter, during
waking hours only). Quit rates were higher in the 16-hour a day
patch use group (17/55 participants) compared to the 24-hour
group (11/51 participants), but CIs encompassed no difference
as well as an effect in the opposite direction (RR 0.70, 95% CI
0.36 to 1.34; 106 participants; Analysis 13.1). Whilst Daughton
1991 reported common AEs, it did not report specifically on
cardiac AEs or SAEs. Overall, 1.3% of participants withdrew
due to treatment, but withdrawals by treatment arm were not
reported (Appendix 2).
• Hughes 2018 found no clear evidence that instructing
participants to continue using a patch in the event of a smoking
lapse resulted in higher quit rates than instructing participants
to stop using a nicotine patch in the event of a lapse: 174/356 quit
in the continuing group and 190/345 in the stopping group (RR
0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.02; 701 participants; Analysis 13.1). Hughes
2018 also found no evidence of an effect of differential NRT use

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

on SAEs, though CIs were wide (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.84; 1
study, 701 participants; Analysis 13.6).
Combination therapy
Combination versus single form
See Summary of findings 1. Pooled data from 16 studies found
greater quit rates following combination NRT treatment when
compared to single-type NRT for smoking cessation (RR 1.27, 95%
CI 1.17 to 1.37; I2 = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants; Analysis
4.1). When split into subgroups, this was equally true for
combination therapy compared to: (1) patch alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI
1.13 to 1.37; I2 = 28%; 13 studies, 9522 participants); (2) a fast-acting
form of NRT alone (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I2 = 0%; 6 studies,
2364 participants); (3) a choice of a single form of NRT (patch or fastacting NRT; RR 5.16, 95% CI 1.18 to 22.6; 1 study, 253 participants).
There was no clear evidence of subgroup differences (I2= 45.8%, P
= 0.16, effect consistent across groups). Results were not sensitive
to removing studies at a high risk of bias.
As this meta-analysis included over 10 studies, we generated a
funnel plot to investigate the likelihood of publication bias (Figure
3). The plot does not provide evidence of publication bias, but as
the number of studies included is low (16 studies), this should be
interpreted with caution.

Whilst 12 of the 16 studies comparing combination NRT to singletype NRT reported some AE data, only three studies reported
cardiac AEs (Caldwell 2016; Cooney 2009; Leung 2019). Two of
these studies were included in a meta-analysis (Cooney 2009;
Leung 2019). This showed wide CIs which are consistent with
both a clinically significant increase and a clinically significant
decrease in cardiac AEs when using combination in comparison
to single-form NRT (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.05; 2 studies,
656 participants; Analysis 4.2). Interpretation was not sensitive to
removing the one study at a high risk of bias (Leung 2019). Caldwell
2016 reported chest discomfort and palpitations at multiple time
points but did not report these cardiac AEs cumulatively across
time points and so could not be included in the meta-analysis.
However, cardiac AEs were generally similar between groups at
each time point (Appendix 2).
In this comparison, SAEs were generally rare, with seven such
events across the five studies that reported SAEs by treatment arm.
CIs were wide and consistent with the possibility of both clinically
significant harm and clinically significant benefit when comparing
SAEs between combination and single-form NRT (RR 4.44, 95%

500

CI 0.76 to 25.85; I2 = 35%; 5 studies, 2888 participants; Analysis
4.3). Subgrouping by the type of single-form NRT used (e.g.
patch alone or fast-acting NRT alone) resulted in no evidence
of subgroup differences (P = 0.23, I2 for subgroup differences
= 29.9%). Pooled subgroup effects also had wide CIs consistent
with both clinically significant benefit and harm when comparing
combination NRT versus patch (RR 11.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 205.90;
4 studies, 2313 participants; Analysis 4.3) and combination NRT
versus fast-acting NRT (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.88; 2 studies, 575
participants; Analysis 4.3). Piper 2009 (1504 participants) reported
32 SAEs not considered related to treatment over six months but
did not report these by trial arm and so could not be included in the
meta-analysis.
Five studies reported withdrawals due to treatment effects by trial
arm; however, only three contributed data to the meta-analysis as
the remaining two reported no withdrawals in any of the relevant
study arms. Comparing treatment withdrawals for combination
NRT versus single-form NRT, there was no evidence of a difference
(RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.20; 5 studies, 3070 participants; Analysis
4.4). However, there was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 73%). When

we divided studies into subgroups, and compared combination
NRT with NRT patch, the point estimate favoured combination NRT;
however, CIs included the possibility of no difference (RR 2.32, 95%
CI 0.99 to 5.40; I2 = 61%; 5 studies, 1982 participants; Analysis 4.4).
The same was observed when we compared combination NRT with
fast-acting forms of NRT (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.08; I2 = not
estimable, as one of the studies had no events; 2 studies, 1088
participants; Analysis 4.4).
Our effect estimates for smoking cessation and any cardiac AE were
not sensitive to the post hoc removal of the Cooney 2009 study,
which focused on a specific population of people with alcohol use
disorder.
Duration of combination therapy
See Summary of findings 2. Two of the studies testing duration of
combination NRT found no evidence of a difference in effect on
abstinence between shorter- and longer-duration therapy (Analysis
5.1). We did not pool these studies in a meta-analysis as they
compared different durations of use. Piper 2016 compared 16-week
to 8-week combination NRT use, with an RR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.75
to 1.23; 637 participants), and Smith 2013 compared 6-week to 2week combination NRT use, with an RR of 1.11 (95% CI 0.94 to
1.31; 987 participants). Smith 2013 was a factorial trial and did not
report results on duration for combination NRT only; we therefore
combined study arms receiving combination NRT and gum alone,
as the authors reported there was no interaction between the two
groups.
We did not include Schlam 2016 in this analysis. The study had a
factorial design and statistical interactions between factors were
reported in the paper. We contacted study authors who supplied
group-by-group quit rates. We checked to see if the odds ratio
(OR) generated from these data resulted in a clinically different
interpretation of the OR generated for the regression model
adjusting for interactions in the paper, for the relevant comparison
of 26- versus 8-week use of combination NRT. The ORs were
similar, but the wider CIs generated from the basic quit-rate data
changed the interpretation of the results. The analysis accounting
for interactions in the paper resulted in an effect of 26-week gum,
with CIs excluding no difference (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.82);
however, the CIs did include the possibility of no difference when
we used basic quit-rate data supplied by the authors (OR 1.42,
95% CI 0.98 to 2.05; 544 participants). This suggests it would be
inappropriate to use the basic quit rates to calculate RRs and 95%
CIs for the duration of combination therapy comparison, ignoring
the interactions detected with other intervention factors.
All three studies testing duration of combination NRT reported
SAEs by trial arm (Analysis 5.2). There were no SAEs in either Piper
2016 or Smith 2013. Schlam 2016 reported no SAEs in the published
paper but reported the occurrence of SAEs on ClinicalTrials.gov.
Analysis of the number of SAEs reported in this trial registry found
wide CIs and included the possibility of no difference, benefit and
harm of longer-term use (i.e. 26 weeks versus eight weeks; RR 1.63,
95% CI 0.60 to 4.42; 1 study, 544 participants; Analysis 5.2).
None of the studies reported treatment withdrawals by trial arm.
Fast-acting NRT versus patch
See Summary of findings 5. None of the studies that compared
a form of fast-acting NRT to nicotine patch found an effect on

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

smoking cessation, whether subgrouped according to type of fastacting NRT or combined (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I2 = 0%; 8
studies, 3319 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in
effects between subgroups (P = 0.57; I2 = 0%; effects for individual
subgroups can be found in Analysis 6.1). The overall effect was not
sensitive to the removal of studies judged to be at a high risk of
bias or the removal of the Moolchan 2005 study, which focused on
adolescents, who may respond differently to NRT treatment. The
latter sensitivity analysis was conducted post hoc.
Only one small study reported cardiac AEs by trial arm (Kupecz
1996). In this study, there were no events in either the gum or patch
groups.
Three of the four studies that reported SAEs by trial arm had
no SAEs (Kupecz 1996; Lerman 2004; Tønnesen 2000). Schnoll
2010b found no evidence of a difference in SAEs between lozenge
and patch groups (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.92; 1 study, 642
participants; Analysis 6.3). Piper 2009 reported 36 SAEs over six
months, but did not report these by trial arm and so could not be
included in a meta-analysis.
When comparing withdrawals due to treatment between fastacting NRT and NRT patches, more participants withdrew in
the fast-acting NRT groups (RR 4.23, 95% CI 1.54 to 11.63;
I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 1482 participants; Analysis 6.4). We also
conducted subgroup analysis by type of fast-acting NRT. When we
compared nasal spray and patch, nasal spray was associated with
more withdrawals (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922
participants; Analysis 6.4), with CIs excluding no difference. The
direction of effect favoured greater risk of withdrawals following
gum versus patch use; however, CIs were very wide (RR 11.00, 95%
CI 0.63 to 191.04; 1 study, 38 participants; Analysis 6.4). There were
no treatment withdrawals in either group in the study comparing
lozenge with patch.
Fast-acting NRT
Type
See Summary of findings 6. One small study of 100 participants
compared smoking cessation rates across three types of fast-acting
NRT (oral spray, gum and inhaler) (Bolliger 2007). CIs were wide and
encompassed the possibility of no difference for all comparisons
(Analysis 7.1). Whilst this study reported some adverse event data,
it did not report on cardiac AEs, SAEs or treatment withdrawals.
Gum dose
Five studies compared 4 mg to 2 mg gum use. Overall, 4 mg
gum had a greater effect on long-term abstinence, with CIs
excluding no difference (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83; I2 = 63%;
5 studies, 856 participants; Analysis 8.1), but with moderate
statistical heterogeneity between studies. In this group of studies,
we conducted subgroup analyses to test whether effects differed
between people with low- and high-dependency on smoking
(this was not consistently done in other groups of studies). Our
post hoc subgroup analysis found that when we split studies/
participants into people with lower-dependency (Garvey 2000;
Hughes 1990; Kornitzer 1987), and higher-dependency (Garvey
2000; Herrera 1995; Kornitzer 1987; Tønnesen 1988), with Garvey
2000 and Kornitzer 1987 split across the two subgroups, this
heterogeneity reduced substantially. We found a benefit of the
4 mg dose (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.50; I2 = 13%; 4 studies,

618 participants) in people highly-dependent on smoking, with
CIs excluding no difference, and no clear evidence of an effect in
people with low-dependency (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.21; I2 =
0%; 3 studies, 238 participants). There was evidence of a subgroup
difference (P = 0.002; I2 = 90%). None of the studies included in this
subgroup analysis were at high risk of bias; however, the findings
from this analysis is limited by a low number of studies and an
uneven covariate distribution.
One small study reported palpitations by trial arm (Tønnesen 1988).
Palpitations were greater in 4 mg compared to 2 mg gum doses,
but CIs were wide and also encompassed the opposite effect (RR
3.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 85.97; 1 study, 60 participants; Analysis 8.2).
No studies comparing gum dose reported on SAEs. However, two
studies reported withdrawals due to treatment by trial arm (Garvey
2000; Tønnesen 1988). There was no evidence of an effect of gum
dose on treatment withdrawals (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.18 to 6.36; I2 =
0%; 2 studies, 465 participants; Analysis 8.3).
Gum duration
Hall 2009 found no effect of 50-week gum use over 10-week
gum use on smoking abstinence. Eighty-five of 203 participants
quit in the 50-week duration group and 80 of 199 participants
in the 10-week duration group (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.32;
402 participants; Analysis 13.1). The 50-week group experienced a
greater number of SAEs, but CIs were wide and also encompassed
the opposite effect (RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.69 to 7.05; 1 study, 402
participants; Analysis 13.6). The same was found for the sensation
of midsternal pressure (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.77; 1 study, 402
participants; Analysis 13.2). It did not report on other cardiac AEs or
treatment withdrawals.
Fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule
There was no clear evidence of an effect of fixed versus ad lib
dosing of fast-acting NRT on abstinence, with the CI including the
possibility of no difference (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.45; I2 = 8%;
4 studies, 828 participants; Analysis 9.1). Two of the studies tested
dosing schedule using gum and two using nasal spray; however,
neither group demonstrated an effect and there was no evidence
of subgroup differences. Removal of one study judged to be at high
risk of bias did not affect the interpretation of subgroup or overall
effect estimates.
Only one small study reported cardiac AEs and SAEs (Tønnesen
1996). However, the cardiac AEs were not reported cumulatively,
or by treatment arm at all time points (Appendix 2). There were no
SAEs in the study.
Three studies reported withdrawals due to treatment. In Tønnesen
1996, there were no withdrawals in either the fixed-dose or the
ad lib nasal spray groups. Killen 1990 found no evidence of a
difference between fixed-dose and ad lib gum (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49
to 1.59; 1 study, 299 participants; Analysis 9.3). Rey 2009 reported
4% treatment withdrawals across the study, but did not report
these by trial arm.
NRT preloading versus standard post-quit use
See Summary of findings 7. Overall, evidence from nine studies
comparing NRT use with no NRT use before a quit day, whilst
concurrently smoking, found a positive effect of NRT preloading on

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 4395
participants; Analysis 10.1), with CIs excluding no difference.
We split participants in the included studies into three subgroups:
people who used a patch only for preloading; people who used
a patch plus gum; and people who used gum only (Bullen
2010 and Piper 2016 were included in all three groups, as they
each had distinct groups of participants who used patch alone,
gum alone, or both). The clear positive effect of preloading was
only found in those participants where a patch only was used (RR
1.28, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.49; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 3830 participants).
Tests for subgroup differences suggested that there was very little
heterogeneity between subgroup effects (P = 0.43; I2 = 0%), but
the numbers of participants contributing to the gum alone (306
participants) and patch plus gum (259 participants) subgroups
were comparatively low, resulting in wider CIs.
When we removed the five studies judged to be at high risk of
bias for at least one domain from the overall analysis, the CIs for
the pooled effect widened but the point estimate still favoured
the intervention (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.46; 4 studies, 1444
participants).
One study reported palpitations (Preloading Investigators 2018),
with an increased likelihood found in the preloading arm and
CIs excluding no difference (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.62; 1792
participants; Analysis 10.2). One study reported cardiac AEs
(Bullen 2010), with no difference detected between study arms;
however, CIs were wide (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.15; 1100
participants; Analysis 10.3). Three studies reported cardiac SAEs,
and again demonstrated no clear evidence of a difference, with
CIs incorporating the potential for both benefit and harm of the
intervention, as well as no difference (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.65;
I2 = 0%; 3529 participants; Analysis 10.4). Four studies reported
overall SAEs, and as with cardiac SAEs, found no clear evidence
of a difference (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.09; I2 = 0%; 3908
participants; Analysis 10.5). The one study reporting treatment
withdrawals also found no evidence of a difference between NRT
preloading and standard post-quit use (Rose 1998) (RR 0.33, 95% CI
0.01 to 7.95; 80 participants; Analysis 10.6).
Cost of NRT
Free versus purchased
One study found greater quit rates in the group receiving free
over purchased patches in an over-the-counter setting (Hays 1999);
however, CIs were wide and also encompassed the possibility of
lower quit rates (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.99; 636 participants).
Another small study investigating the cost of nicotine gum for
participants receiving brief physician advice also found greater quit
rates in the free gum group compared to the 'close to full price'
gum group (Hughes 1991); however, CIs were wide and included the
possibility of the opposite effect, as well as no difference (RR 2.70,
95% CI 0.89 to 8.20; 104 participants). This is despite the fact that
people who could get free gum were much more likely to obtain it.
Only Hays 1999 reported cardiac AEs, finding no clear evidence of
a difference between free and purchased patches (RR 0.55, 95% CI
0.18 to 1.61; 1 study, 636 participants; Analysis 11.2). Neither study
reported on treatment withdrawals.

Duration of free NRT
Abdullah 2013 compared abstinence rates when participants
were provided with two weeks versus one week of free NRT
(participants were encouraged to use NRT for eight to 12 weeks
in total). The point estimate favoured the longer duration of free
treatment; however, the CIs also incorporate the possibility of
no difference between groups (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.70; 562
participants; Analysis 12.1). Burns 2016 provided participants with
eight weeks versus four weeks of free NRT (participants were
encouraged to use NRT for 10 weeks in total), and found no clear
evidence of an effect on abstinence (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.48;
1495 participants; Analysis 12.1). Neither study reported AEs.
Participant- versus clinician-selected NRT
Walker 2011 found that providing participants with a one-week
free NRT selection box (including one patch, gum, inhaler,
sublingual tablets and oral pouches), followed by eight weeks
of free participant-selected NRT did not result in higher quit
rates than providing participants with eight weeks of clinicianselected NRT patches or gum (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.83; 1410
participants; Analysis 13.1). However, this RR and 95% CI are based
on quit rates validated by saliva sample analysis (63/706 and 49/704
quit in the selection box and control groups, respectively), and
a very low proportion of participants who claimed to have quit
completed verification (34%). We therefore conducted a sensitivity
analysis using data extrapolated from validated proportions to the
wider trial population (161/706 and 136/704 quit in the selection
box and control groups, respectively: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96 to
1.45; 1410 participants), and non-verified, self-reported quit rates
(143/706 and 133/704 quit in the selection box and control groups,
respectively: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33; 1410 participants). None
of the three analyses showed clear evidence of between-group
differences, and there were no differences in clinical interpretation
across sensitivity analyses (Analysis 13.1). Walker 2011 also found
no evidence of a difference in SAEs between groups, with wide CIs
(RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.50; 1 study, 1410 participants; Analysis
13.6).
Other variations in NRT use
Tulloch 2016 was not entered into any meta-analyses. Although
it compared combination patch plus fast-acting NRT to patch
alone, there were other variations in the NRT use that may have
confounded the effect. The patches used in the combination arm
were self-titrated to a maximum of 35 mg and used over 22 weeks,
whereas the patches in the control arm were a maximum of 21
mg (depending on cigarettes per day), used over 10 weeks with
tapering of dose from week seven. The study found higher quit
rates in the intervention group (29/233 quit) versus the control
group (23/230 quit); however, CIs included the possibility of no
difference and of the opposite effect (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.75 to
2.10; 486 participants; Analysis 13.1). Furthermore, the study found
no clear evidence of a difference between the intervention and
control groups for cardiac AEs (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.48; 1
study, 490 participants; Analysis 13.3), SAEs (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24
to 1.84; 1 study, 490 participants; Analysis 13.6) or withdrawals
due to treatment (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.60; 1 study, 490
participants; Analysis 13.7), with all point estimates accompanied
by wide CIs.
Similarly, LeBlanc 2017 compared 10 weeks of combination patch
plus fast-acting NRT (nicotine inhaler) to 10 weeks of patch

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

treatment alone. Patches used in the combination arm were also
titrated based on smoking history, while patches used alone were
of standard dose (definition of standard dose not specified), thus
potentially confounding the effect. At 52-week follow-up, this
study reported a difference in quit rates of 5.4% in biochemicallyconfirmed abstinence rates between groups, with imprecise CIs (OR
1.51, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.02; 303 participants).
Finally, Berlin 2011 compared (1) providing a nicotine dose aimed
at substituting 100% (± 5%) of participants' nicotine, prescribed
based on the previous week's saliva cotinine concentrations and
delivered in the form of a patch, with gum or lozenge (as needed) to
(2) standard care, in which nicotine patches were delivered by fixed
monthly dose decreases (mixed based on dependence) with gum or
lozenge (as needed). At six months' follow-up, the study found no
clear evidence of a difference between study groups for outcomes
of smoking cessation (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.57; 1 study, 310
participants; Analysis 13.1), chest pain (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.20;
1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.4), palpitations (RR 2.50, 95%
CI 0.49 to 12.69; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.5) or SAEs (RR
0.75, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.73; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.6).

DISCUSSION
Summary of main results
This review summarises and evaluates the evidence investigating
the relative efficacy and safety of different types of nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) use for smoking cessation, including
variations in duration, dose and modes of delivery. A review of NRT
versus controls for smoking cessation has already been published
(Hartmann-Boyce 2018). It provides high-certainty evidence that
offering NRT to people who are dependent on smoking but
prepared to attempt to quit increases their chance of success over
that achieved with the same level of support but without NRT.
This review adds to those findings by investigating different NRT
use approaches, to understand which approaches maximise the
likelihood of smoking cessation at six months or longer.
This review includes 68 completed studies investigating the
effects of: NRT dose; duration of treatment; use in combination
versus single form; different types of NRT; a fixed versus ad lib
dosing schedule; preloading; and the provision of free NRT. All
studies reported smoking abstinence at least six months following
baseline; however, cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse
events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured
variably and infrequently.
This review update continues to provide high-certainty evidence
that the use of combination NRT results in higher quit rates than
single-form NRT. This finding held true regardless of whether that
single form was a patch or a fast-acting version, such as gum or
lozenge, or a choice of patch or fast-acting single-form NRT. For
patch dose comparisons, we judged the evidence to be of moderate
certainty due to imprecision. Of the patch dose comparisons, 21 mg
patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches;
25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 15 mg (16-hour)
patches, although the confidence interval (CI) included one; and
there was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22
mg (24-hour) patches. In addition, results suggest that using 4 mg
nicotine gum results in higher quit rates than using 2 mg nicotine
gum. A post hoc subgroup analysis accounted for the moderate
heterogeneity in the associated analysis. It indicated that this may

only be true in smokers who are highly dependent, and that 4
mg and 2 mg gum may result in similar quit rates when used by
people less dependent on smoking. However, this finding should
be treated with caution and tested in primary, adequately-powered
studies to strengthen the evidence in this area. Moderate-certainty
evidence indicates that nicotine preloading (i.e. the use of NRT
before the quit date) results in higher quit rates than using NRT from
quit day onwards. However, when we removed the five studies (of
nine) at high risk of bias from the analysis, the clear evidence of a
positive effect did not remain. It is not possible to say conclusively
that this was due to bias, and could be because removing more than
half of the studies meant that the sample size was reduced by more
than half, making the result less precise.
We found no clear evidence of an effect for: duration of nicotine
patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily
patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very
low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt
patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence);
duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fastacting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of
free NRT; ceasing versus continuous patch use on lapse; and
participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, this lack of
evidence of an effect should not be interpreted as proof that these
different forms of NRT will result in equal quit rates. In many cases,
these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence
and the findings of single studies. The exception to this is the highcertainty evidence which suggests that using a form of fast-acting
NRT alone, such as gum or lozenge, results in similar quit rates to
using a nicotine patch.
Many studies did not report cardiac AEs separately or did not
report AEs and SAEs at all. Where these were reported, there
was no evidence of differential cardiac AEs or overall SAEs across
comparisons. Both rates were low or very low overall, except
for one study of nicotine preloading, which found an excess of
palpitations in the preloading arm. However, due to variations in
reporting, we rate the evidence on which these findings were based
as low or very low certainty. The number of withdrawals from
trials reported to be due to treatment was also variably reported
across studies. We rated the contributing evidence to be of low
and very low certainty. For most comparisons, the frequency of
these withdrawals was similar between groups; however, more
withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using
nasal spray (3.0%) in comparison to patch (0.9%) in one trial, and
in participants using 42/44 mg patches (6.1%) in comparison to
21/22 mg patches (1.1%) across two trials (low-certainty evidence).
In both cases, the withdrawal rates due to treatment were low, so
their clinical relevance may be limited when considered alongside
other clinical factors, such as initial patient preference and efficacy.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
We conducted broad searches for this review to identify any studies
where NRT was used as treatment. Although there was no intention
to update the review of NRT versus control (Hartmann-Boyce 2018),
updated search results were needed for a forthcoming component
network meta-analysis on pharmacological interventions for
smoking cessation that will also include NRT versus control
studies (Lindson 2022). Through this process of screening studies,
we can be confident in our approach for identifying all studies
that compared one form or delivery mode of NRT with another,
regardless of how clear this was at the first stage of eligibility

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

screening. We also searched trial registers to identify any ongoing
or completed, but unpublished, registered studies comparing NRT
to another form of NRT.
Although the evidence base investigating the efficacy of NRT versus
control (no NRT) is considerable and judged to be stable and of
high certainty (Hartmann-Boyce 2018), the evidence base exploring
the optimal methods of NRT use is less developed. Although
this review includes 67 studies, there are many comparisons of
interest; in many cases, the studies and participants contributing
to a comparison are sparse, and further research could strengthen
or change findings. Although smoking abstinence was reported
in all included studies (as this was an inclusion criterion), AEs,
SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were reported rarely and
inconsistently across studies, making it difficult to carry out metaanalyses and draw conclusions.
Studies included in this review update recruited people who
smoked, who were motivated to quit and were typically 18 years or
older. Across the studies in this review, the highest mean number
of cigarettes per day was 38. Caution should therefore be exercised
when attempting to generalise results outside these populations.
We did not consider the evidence on nicotine-containing electronic
cigarettes in this review, although they may be considered a mode
of nicotine delivery. Studies of electronic cigarettes for smoking
cessation are included in a separate review (Hartmann-Boyce
2022).

Certainty of the evidence
Of the 68 studies included in this review, we judged nine to be at
low risk of bias for all domains, and 28 to be at high risk in one or
more domains. We deemed the overall risk of bias for the remaining
31 studies to be unclear. In many cases, we had to rate studies at
an unclear risk due to a lack of reporting of key information. To
investigate the potential impact of studies that we judged to be
at high risk of bias on results, we carried out sensitivity analyses,
removing these studies and observing the effects on results. In
most cases, this had no effect on the clinical interpretation of the
analyses. However, removing the five studies we judged to be at
high risk of bias from the analysis of NRT preloading versus NRT
use from quit day onward did affect the results. Originally, the
results showed a positive effect of NRT preloading on smoking
quit rates with CIs only encompassing beneficial effects; however,
after the five high-risk studies were removed, the CIs widened and
included the potential for no effect and for a benefit of the no
preloading comparator. The direction of the effect of the pooled
point estimate still favoured the intervention; however, the number
of participants in the analysis halved, which will have contributed
to the imprecision of the results.
We did not assess the potential bias imposed by studies funded
by industry in this review. Given we investigated variations in the
form, dose, delivery, duration and schedule of NRT, rather than the
effectiveness of NRT compared to a placebo, we deemed industry
funding of studies less applicable in this context.
We assessed the certainty of the evidence by creating summary
of findings tables and carrying out GRADE ratings for seven of
the comparisons: combination versus single-form NRT (Summary
of findings 1); duration of combination therapy (Summary of
findings 2); patch dose (Summary of findings 3); duration of
patch use (Summary of findings 4); fast-acting NRT versus nicotine

patch (Summary of findings 5); type of fast-acting NRT (Summary
of findings 6); NRT preloading versus standard post-quit use
(Summary of findings 7), across all outcomes, where possible. Two
of the seven comparisons we assessed generated high-certainty
evidence for the efficacy of treatment for smoking cessation:
combination versus single-form NRT, and fast-acting NRT versus
nicotine patch. We judged the NRT preloading versus standard postquit use comparison to generate moderate-certainty evidence. We
rated the remaining efficacy comparisons to be of low or very low
certainty. In all cases where data were available to contribute to any
of the safety analyses for these comparisons, we rated the evidence
to be of low or very low certainty. This was largely due to the fact
that very few studies contributed data to these analyses, and where
they did, the number of events was very low. We present effect
estimates as risk ratios, as these are easier to interpret than odds
ratios, but this means that where there are no events measured
in both comparison groups, risk ratios cannot be calculated and
therefore do not contribute to the meta-analysis. We considered
alternative statistical approaches to dealing with this data analysis.
However, we concluded that other approaches would be more
difficult to interpret and that overall conclusions would not change
as a result.
The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were imprecision
(low overall numbers of participants and events), risk of bias
(judgements of high risk that may affect the result) and
heterogeneity (high statistical heterogeneity detected in metaanalyses).

Potential biases in the review process
We consider the review process used to be robust and do not
believe we have introduced any biases. We followed the standard
methods for outcome assessment for Cochrane Tobacco Addiction
Review Group cessation reviews. Our search strategy included the
Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, and we
captured an ongoing study. However, there may be unpublished
data that our searches did not uncover. We did not screen the
references lists of included studies uniformly across versions
of this review. We also considered participants lost to followup as continuing to smoke, which is current best practice in
this field of work (West 2005). Due to the limited number of
studies contributing to each comparison, we could only create
one funnel plot, comparing combination NRT to single-form NRT.
This provided no evidence of publication bias, although only 16
studies contributed (a relatively small number), so this should be
interpreted with caution.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews
There is high-certainty evidence to suggest that NRT is a safe and
effective treatment for quitting smoking (Hartmann-Boyce 2018).
Evidence for the effect of NRT relative to other pharmacotherapies
for smoking cessation can be found in a Cochrane Reviews of
nicotine agonists (Livingstone-Banks 2023), as well as in a Cochrane
Review of antidepressants for smoking cessation (Hajizadeh 2023).
In addition, there is a Cochrane overview of pharmacotherapies
for smoking cessation, which also provides indirect comparisons
(Cahill 2013); a new, revised version of this network meta-analysis
is expected to be available in 2023 (Lindson 2022). Thomas
2022 also conducted a network meta-analysis investigating the
comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies for

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

smoking cessation. The combined evidence from these reviews
suggests that, overall, NRT is as effective a quitting aid as the
antidepressant bupropion but is less effective than the nicotine
agonist varenicline. However, availability of varenicline is limited
due to production issues at the time of writing, and there is
evidence that combination NRT is as effective as varenicline. This
aligns with the findings of this review, which has found highcertainty evidence that combination NRT is more effective than
single forms of NRT.
Clinical practice guidelines in the USA (Fiore 2008; Patnode
2021; US Preventive Services Task Force 2021), New Zealand
(NZ MoH 2021), and England (NICE 2022) are consistent with
the finding that combination NRT is more effective than single
forms of NRT, although British prescribing guidelines do not
mention the combination of different forms of NRT (BNF 2018).
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance
does not currently recommend nicotine preloading and explicitly
recommends starting NRT on the day before the target quit
date (NICE 2022). Preloading is not addressed in some American
guidance (Fiore 2008), and is not explicitly recommended in
British and other American guidance (BNF 2018; Patnode 2021; US
Preventive Services Task Force 2021). British prescribing guidelines
and some American guidelines support the use of higher-dose
preparations of NRT in people highly dependent on smoking
(BNF 2018; Fiore 2008); this is not included in the US Preventive
Services Task Force 2021 guidance. National guidelines have given
less consideration to the other comparisons addressed by this
review. New Zealand's Ministry of Health guidelines for helping
people stop smoking recommend at least eight weeks of NRT
use, and state that people can use NRT for longer than 12 weeks
when needed (NZ MoH 2021). Currently, our findings do not
find clear evidence of increased effectiveness of longer NRT use.
However, our confidence in the evidence for this finding ranges
from low to very low certainty, and more evidence would aid
our interpretation. Appendix 3 highlights key elements of British
prescribing guidance (British National Formulary (BNF)) as these
relate to the comparisons in this review.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Implications for practice
• Combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in
approximately 17% to 37% higher long-term quit rates than a
single form of NRT.
• 4 mg nicotine gum results in approximately 12% to 83%
higher quit rates than 2 mg nicotine gum, although there is
some evidence to suggest this may vary based on nicotine
dependence.
• Forms of fast-acting NRT, such as gum and lozenge, are as
effective a cessation aid as nicotine patches.
• There is some evidence that using 21 mg (24-hour) nicotine
patches results in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) nicotine
patches; however, further evidence could strengthen or weaken
this effect.
• There is some evidence that using NRT before a quit day could
result in higher quit rates than beginning NRT on a quit day;
however, due to potential risks of bias in the existing studies,
further research could strengthen or weaken this effect.

• There is insufficient evidence indicating that any other
characteristics of NRT influence the efficacy of NRT for smoking
cessation.
• There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether different
types or methods of NRT delivery result in more frequent
cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) or
withdrawals due to treatment. However, these events are rare,
and NRT is generally considered to be well-tolerated.
• These conclusions all apply to adults who smoke, who are
motivated to quit and who smoke approximately 20 or more
cigarettes per day. There is little evidence about the role of NRT
for individuals smoking fewer than 15 cigarettes a day.

Implications for research
• More high-quality studies are needed to assess the efficacy
of higher versus lower patch doses, different durations of
NRT treatment course, different types of fast-acting NRT, and
NRT preloading versus standard NRT use. In particular, wellconducted studies examining the use of fast-acting NRT or
combination NRT for preloading would add to the existing
evidence base. Studies in people smoking fewer than 15
cigarettes a day or more than 40 cigarettes a day, and in younger
age groups, would also add to the existing evidence base.
• New studies should ensure that they report adverse events
and withdrawals due to treatment, and that these numbers are
reported separately by study arm, as well as overall.

CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDIES
Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Abdullah 2013
Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: parallel RCT
Country: China
Recruitment: from a smoking cessation health centre - smokers who called the booking line and attended the health centre during the study period were recruited by smoking cessation counsellor

Participants

562 smokers: aged ≥ 16 years, ≥ 5 cigarettes per day, clearly motivated to quit
78.3% men; average cigarettes per day: 18.8; average years smoking: 18.5

Interventions

1) 2 weeks of free NRT (patch or gum according to participant preference). However, participants were
encouraged to use NRT for 8 to 12 weeks, sourcing the remainder themselves.
2) 1 week of free NRT (patch or gum according to participant preference). However, participants were
encouraged to use NRT for 8 to 12 weeks, sourcing the remainder themselves.

Outcomes

PPA at 6-month follow-up; CO validated (< 9 ppm)
Other abstinence measures: self-reported 7-day PPA at 6 months; self-reported 24-hour PPA at 6 and 12
months; self-reported continuous at 6 and 12 months; quit for at least 24 hours at some point before 6and 12-month follow-up
Adverse events: not measured

Notes

70% of participants chose patch, 30% chose gum, with similar between-group percentages
The study was funded by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (COSH). Pfizer Consumers and
Novartis partially sponsored the printing cost of the clinic pamphlets and provided some free NRT samples.
Conflicts of interest: the authors declared no conflict of interests

Random sequence generation (selection bias)

Low risk

Quote: “The random numbers for group assignment were generated by the research assistant (not the counselors) of the project using a personal computer
before subject recruitment.”

Allocation concealment
(selection bias)

Low risk

Quote: “Eligible selected subjects signed the consent form and completed
the baseline measures…before the counselor opened a serially numbered,
opaque, and sealed envelope (SNOSE) to reveal the random assignment of
each smoker to A1 or A2 group.”

Blinding (performance
bias and detection bias)
All outcomes

Low risk

Quote: “An independent interviewer, who was unaware of the subject’s group
allocation, carried out the 6 and 12 months follow-up interview.”
Participants were aware whether they were provided 1 or 2 weeks of free NRT;
however, it would be impossible to blind for this

Low risk

Dropout rates at 6 months were 75/278 in group 1 (2 weeks of free NRT) and
83/284 in group 2 (1 week of free NRT). There was therefore less than 50%
dropout overall and rates were similar between groups.

Baker 2016
Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: parallel RCT
Country: USA
Recruitment: participants were recruited from 2 sources: (1) by contacting participants in the authors'
ongoing longitudinal study of smokers, the Wisconsin Smokers Health Study; and (2) by media and
community outreach

Participants

1086 smokers (662 in relevant trial arms): aged > 17 years, ≥ 5 cigarettes per day, desire to quit smoking
but not engaged in smoking treatment, willingness to use the tested cessation treatments and not using e-cigarettes
47.9% men; average age: 48.1 years; average cigarettes per day: 17; average FTND: 4.8; average exhaled
CO: 15.1 ppm

Interventions

1) Combination NRT: nicotine patch (12 weeks: 21 mg for 8 weeks, 14 mg for 2 weeks, 7 mg for 2 weeks)
and lozenge (12 weeks: 2 mg or 4 mg based on addiction level, asked to use at least 5 lozenges a day)
2) Nicotine patch only (12 weeks: 21 mg for 8 weeks, 14 mg for 2 weeks, 7 mg for 2 weeks)
In both groups, treatment began on quit day.

Outcomes

7-day PPA at 52 weeks' follow-up; CO validated (≤ 5 ppm)
Other abstinence measures: 7-day PPA at 26 weeks with CO validation; self-reported prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks (no smoking from day 7 to day 181 post-quit day)
Adverse events: measured for duration of treatment (12 weeks)

Notes

This was a 3-arm trial comparing varenicline, nicotine patch and nicotine patch plus lozenge. For the
purposes of this review, we are only interested in the nicotine patch and nicotine patch plus lozenge
groups.
The study was funded by grant 5R01HL109031 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and
grant K05CA139871 from the National Cancer Institute.
Conflicts of interest: Dr Stein reports receipt of data and safety monitoring board honoraria from Lilly
and Abbott. No other disclosures were reported.

All outcomes

Low risk

Overall loss to follow-up across all 3 groups at 12 months = 22.5%. Loss to follow-up of 22.4% in nicotine patch group and 21.6% in the combination NRT
group; therefore similar between trial arms of interest. We obtained information on losses to follow-up directly from the study authors.

Berlin 2011
Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: parallel RCT
Country: France
Recruitment: people attending smoking cessation clinics were invited to participate

Participants

310 smokers with medical comorbidities ('known smoking-related disorder or an underlying disease
with increased risk for smoking-related illnesses')
62.6% men; mean age: 50 years; ≥ 10 cigarettes per day; average cigarettes per day: 25.4; motivated to
quit

Interventions

1) Standard care: nicotine patches with monthly dose decreases; buccal absorption NRT products of
gum (2 mg) or lozenges (1.5 mg) could be co-administered at the discretion of the investigator. Patch
dose regime was mixed, based on dependence (FTND score and number of cigarettes per day). Co-administration of a second nicotine patch was not permitted.
• FTND ≥ 5 or cigarettes per day ≥ 20: 21 mg 24-hour patch followed by a monthly decrease to 21 mg/24
hours to 7 mg/24 hours.
• FTND < 5 or cigarettes per day < 20: 14 mg 24-hour patch for 2 months; 7 mg/24 hours during month 3.
2) Dose adaptation: 'received a nicotine dose (either by patch or buccal absorption NRT or both) according to the saliva cotinine concentration based on a saliva cotinine/daily NRT dose conversion factor of 0.1'; aimed for 100% (± 5%) substitution.
All participants received counselling (type and content at discretion of investigator) for at least 10 minutes at each visit, starting at the pre-quit inclusion visit.

Outcomes

Continuous abstinence at 6 months' follow-up
Validation: CO validated (≤ 8 ppm)
Serious adverse events and adverse events

Notes

Funding: "The trial was funded by the Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique (PHRC) Loco-regional 2004, registration number: 050558 and Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de
santé (AFSSAPS), Convention Pharmacologie Clinique et Thérapeutique 2003. Nicotine patches, nicotine gums and nicotine lozenges were generously provided by Pierre Fabre Santé. The study’s sponsor

7 participants changed their product during treatment: 2 from spray to gum
and inhaler (1 each), 2 from gum to spray and inhaler (1 each), 3 from inhaler
to spray (n = 2) and gum (n = 1); all 7 were considered treatment failures according to the principle of intention-to-treat
Only 46% of participants attended final follow-up (12 months), i.e. less than
50% of those randomised. There was differential dropout between groups

Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: parallel RCT
Country: USA
Recruitment: by the Colorado quit-line - participants were recruited during regular initial quit-line calls

Participants

1495 smokers: smoking 16 to 20 cigarettes per day, agreed to receive free NRT, absence of a condition
requiring physician approval for NRT
40.0% men; average cigarettes per day 19.8; most smoked within 5 minutes of waking and had been
smoking for > 10 years

Interventions

1) 4 weeks of free NRT (patches). However, participants were encouraged to complete 10 weeks of NRT,
sourcing the remainder themselves.
2) 8 weeks of free NRT (patches), shipped in 2 x 4-week batches. Participants were required to request
the second batch. Participants were encouraged to complete 10 weeks of NRT, sourcing the remainder
themselves.

Outcomes

Self-reported prolonged abstinence at 6-month post-quit day; no biochemical validation
Other abstinence measures: self-reported 7-day and 30-day PPA at 6 months
Adverse events: not measured

Notes

Only two-thirds of group 2 (8 weeks of free NRT) accepted second 4-week batch of NRT. Median time

Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: parallel RCT
Country: New Zealand
Recruitment: from media advertisements, clinician referrals, and a database of people interested in trying to stop smoking

Participants

1423 smokers: aged 18 to 70 years, ≥ 9 cigarettes per day, FTND ≥ 3. Ineligible if currently taking psychoactive medication/illicit drugs, drank > 28 units of alcohol a week, had hyperthyroidism/diabetes/severe renal or hepatic disease, were female and using inadequate contraception or were breastfeeding
46% men; mean age 45; average cigarettes per day: 20; mean FTND: 6.1

Interventions

1) 6 months of nicotine oral spray parallel to 5 months of free 24-hour nicotine patch. Each spray actuation contained 1 mg nicotine.
2. 6 months of placebo oral spray parallel to 5 months of free 24-hour nicotine patch. The placebo spray
was dispensed in opaque bottles identical to the nicotine spray.
Both groups were instructed to use the spray ad libitum whenever they felt the urge to smoke, up to a
maximum of 30 sprays/day.
Both groups received 21 mg/24-hour nicotine patches for 18 weeks, then 14 mg/24-hour nicotine
patches for 2 weeks, and then 7 mg/24-hour nicotine patches for 2 weeks.

Outcomes

Prolonged abstinence at 12 months' post-quit day; CO-validated (< 10 ppm). Prolonged abstinence defined as no smoking since end of grace period (4 weeks after quit day) to 12 months' post-quit day
Other abstinence measures: 7-day PPA at 12-month follow-up (CO-validated)
Adverse events: measured for 12 months (treatment was for 6 months)

Notes

Participants

502 smokers: aged 18 to 70 years, ≥ 9 cigarettes per day, FTND ≥ 3
49% men; mean age: 45; average cigarettes per day: 19; mean FTND: 6.2

Interventions

1) 6 months of nicotine inhaler used parallel to 5 months of 24-hour nicotine patch. The nicotine inhaler
contained 2 doses of nicotine lactate: 100 micrograms/puff and 200 micrograms/puff. Participants were
instructed to start with the lower dose and move onto the higher dose once they had developed tolerance to the upper airway effects of the lower dose.
2) 6 months of placebo inhaler used parallel to 5 months of 24-hour nicotine patch. The placebo inhaler
contained menthol in 2 doses to mimic the 2 doses of active inhaler and participants were also instructed to move onto the higher dose once they had developed tolerance to the upper airway effects of the
lower dose.
Both groups were instructed to use the inhaler when they had an urge to smoke, and to have as many
puffs as required to satisfy their urge (maximum 10 puffs).
Both groups were instructed to use 21 mg/24-hour nicotine patch for 18 weeks, 14 mg/24-hour for 2
weeks, and 7 mg/24-hour for 2 weeks.

Outcomes

Prolonged abstinence (defined as not even a puff) at 6-month post-quit date; CO-validated at 1-month
visit (≤ 10 ppm)
Other abstinence measures: self-reported 7-day PPA at 6 months, self-reported prolonged abstinence

59.7% men; average age 56.7 years; average cigarettes per day 20.5; mean FTND 4.8; average years regular smoking 37.8

Interventions

Factorial 2 x 2 design: extended NRT and extended CBT
All participants completed a 12-week treatment programme that included group counselling, 12 weeks
of bupropion and 10 weeks of nicotine gum (beginning on quit day). Participants were asked to taper
their gum use down completely by week 12.
1) Standard treatment: participants received no further treatment after week 12
2) Extended NRT: participants were provided with another 40 weeks of nicotine gum from their quit day
(a total of 50 weeks of gum treatment). No CBT past 12 weeks
3) Extended CBT: participants received 11 additional CBT sessions between weeks 10 and 52. 10 weeks
of NRT
4) Extended NRT and extended CBT: participants received an extra 40 weeks of nicotine gum and an additional 11 CBT sessions following the planned quit day (total 50 weeks gum treatment)

Adverse events: measured to week 104 (treatment was to week 50)

Notes

Factorial trial: authors do not appear to have tested for any interaction between the effects of the 2 interventions tested. However, the review team carried out the same analysis, testing for an interaction
at the relevant follow-up point, and found no statistically significant interaction. As there was no significant interaction between the 2 treatments tested, we combined groups 1 and 3, and groups 2 and 4
for meta-analysis, so that we could compare 50 weeks extended NRT treatment to 10 weeks 'standard'
NRT treatment.

Prolonged abstinence at 6 months (from 2 weeks post-quit) verified at each follow-up visit
(12-month follow-up only completed for 11/13 sites)
Validation: CO ≤ 10 ppm
Adverse events: measured up to 10 weeks and then at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Note: measurement at 12 months only occurred at some sites. Treatment duration was to 16 weeks

Notes

6-month abstinence rates used in analyses, since not all centres completed 12-month follow-up due to
sponsor termination of study. Denominators confirmed by author

Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: parallel RCT
Country: USA
Recruitment: through internet sites, such as Craigslist, and referral by friends already enrolled

Participants

701 smokers: aged ≥ 18 years, ≥ 10 cigarettes per day for ≥ 1 year, probably or definitely intend to quit
smoking in the next month, no medical caution to use of patch, no use of other nicotine or tobacco
products in the last month
43.5% men; average cigarettes per day: 19; FTND: 5.5; average age started smoking: 17.8; any prior quit
attempt: 78%

Interventions

1) Participants advised to 'continue' nicotine patch use in the case of a lapse post-quit day. Those in the
'continue patch' condition were told: “If you smoke after quitting, continue to use the nicotine patches.

Wearing the patches will make it easier for you to return to not smoking. We know that using the patches and smoking a few cigarettes is not harmful. So, if you slip and have a cigarette after quitting, return to not smoking as soon as possible, get rid of any cigarettes you may have, and continue to use the
nicotine patches. Do you have any questions or concerns about this?” To minimise adverse events, participants were also told to only use the patch while smoking if they were smoking ≤ 75% of their baseline number of cigarettes per day.
2) Participants advised to 'discontinue' nicotine patch use in the case of a lapse post-quit day. Those
in the 'discontinue patch' condition were told: “If you smoke after quitting, take off your patch for the
rest of the day. Using the patches while smoking may give you nicotine levels that are too high, and it's
not known if patch use while smoking helps smokers quit. So, if you slip and have a cigarette after quitting, return to not smoking as soon as possible, get rid of any cigarettes you may have, but stop using
the patch the day you slip, and resume use on future days only if you completely stop smoking again.
Do you have any questions or concerns about this?”
For both groups, counsellors delivered the instructions above at least 8 times throughout the interventions, and patches were provided for 10 weeks post-quit date. For all participants, the behavioural
counselling protocol was based on USPHS [United States Public Health Service] Clinical Practice Guidelines that emphasise the provision of social support and problem-solving around high-risk-for-lapse situations. Counselling was delivered in 6 proactive phone calls that occurred 7 and 3 days before, and 2,
7, 14 and 28 days after participants' designated quit date. The first call lasted about 20 minutes; subsequent calls were 10 to 15 minutes.
Outcomes

Self-reported 7-day PPA smoking abstinence at 6 months post-quit
Other abstinence measures: self-reported 7-day PPA at 4 months post-quit
Adverse events: measured to 1 week post-treatment (12 weeks)

Methods

Study design: prospective quasi-experimental design
Country: USA
Recruitment: smokers attending for smoking cessation treatment at the Veterans’ Affairs Medical Center in Denver between September 1992 and March 1993 (following self-enrolment or referral by physician or nurse) were invited to participate

Participants

45 smokers: motivated to quit
94.7% men; average age: 50.2 years; average FTND: 7; 69% living in a smoking household environment,
average pack/year history: 47.2 years

Interventions

1) Nicotine patch treatment for 10 weeks (21 mg/day for 6 weeks, then 14 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 7
mg/day for 2 weeks)
2) Nicotine gum: 2 mg pieces (chewed for 20 minutes) ad libitum for 12 weeks, then an individualised
tapering schedule with the goal of discontinuing therapy within the next 12 weeks
All participants began the above treatment on their quit date and attended 4 weekly sessions, which
included contract negotiation, positive reinforcement, relaxation exercises, visual imagery and group
support. Following the cessation programme, participants attended 7 follow-up sessions.

Outcomes

PPA (defined as not smoking at time of asking) 52-week follow-up, validated by exhaled CO < 8 ppm
Other abstinence measures: PPA at 6, 12 and 26 weeks (CO-validated)
Adverse events: recorded at each session or follow-up. Note: follow-up was to 1 year, and treatment
was to 24 weeks

Notes

ITT numbers are not available. There were 7 dropouts after randomisation, but how these were split
across study arms is not reported, making it impossible to perform an ITT analysis. There was no response to a request for the numbers randomised.

High risk

It appears that treatment (gum or patch) was assigned randomly to the month
of recruitment and then all participants recruited in that month received the
allotted treatment rather than allocating treatment to individual participants.
Quote: “A prospective quasi-experimental design was employed…”
Quote: “During this study, patients were assigned to nicotine gum or a nicotine
patch on random months.”
Quote: “A random number table was used to assign which product would be
used. Each month, the nicotine patch or nicotine gum was randomly assigned
to participants in that group by blindly selecting the treatment from an envelope that contained both options.”

Participants

303 smokers: ≥ 10 cigarettes per day; 18+ years of age; willing to set a date to quit smoking within the
30 days following the baseline assessment; 63.4% men

Interventions

1) Control group: 10 weeks of declining, standard-dose, transdermal nicotine patch
2) STEP group: 10 weeks of titrated transdermal nicotine patch (dose based on smoking history) plus ad
libitum nicotine inhaler
All participants received 5 x 15-minute counselling sessions from a smoking cessation counsellor.
These sessions occurred at 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 weeks post-target quit date. Counselling sessions focused
on practical counselling (problem-solving and skills training) and social support.

Outcomes

Continuous smoking abstinence at 52 weeks' follow-up
Validation: biochemically-confirmed with a carbon monoxide breath test
Other abstinence measures: continuous, biochemically-confirmed smoking abstinence at 10 and 26
weeks; validated 7-day PPA at 10, 26 and 52 weeks of follow-up
Adverse events: not reported

Notes

This study was listed as an ongoing study (NCT01622998) in the previous version of this review. Further
information on abstinence outcomes found in a conference abstract allowed this study to be included in the 2023 review update. Limited information could be obtained from abstract (only the risk difference between groups, with an odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval). We contacted study authors

Study characteristics
Methods

Study design: factorial RCT
Country: USA
Recruitment: smokers attending primary care clinics were invited to participate in a research programme to help them quit smoking

Participants

637 smokers; aged ≥ 18 years, ≥ 5 cigarettes per day for 6 months, motivated to quit
45.4% men; average age 45.8 years; average cigarettes per day 17.7; mean FTND 4.8; baseline CO 20.3
ppm; HSI 3.1

Interventions

2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. There were 6 intervention components tested (detailed below) that
were tested in different combinations resulting in 32 study groups.
1) Nicotine patches for 3 weeks prior to quit date (patch preloading) versus no preloading patches
2) Nicotine gum for 3 weeks prior to quit date (gum preloading) versus no preloading gum
3) Preparation counselling versus no preparation counselling
4) Intensive cessation in-person counselling versus minimal in-person counselling
5) Intensive cessation telephone counselling versus minimal telephone counselling
6) 16 weeks of nicotine patch and gum from quit date versus 8 weeks of nicotine patch and gum from
quit date
For the purposes of this review, we are interested in comparisons 1, 2 and 6.

Outcomes

Self-reported 7-day PPA at 6-month post-quit date
Self-reported 7-day PPA at 16-week post-quit date
Validation: none
Adverse events: measured in visits at weeks -1 and 4, and in calls at weeks 8, 16, and 26

Notes

This study had a factorial design, and an interaction between interventions was detected. However, results of a regression accounting for this have been presented in the publication and authors supplied
group-by-group data. We checked to see if the odds ratios generated from these raw data were significantly, clinically different from those generated for the model adjusting for interactions in the paper,
for comparisons 1, 2 and 6. Odds ratios were similar in all cases, and in all cases CIs indicated statistically non-significant results. We have therefore entered raw data, supplied by authors, into meta-analyses. This results in wider confidence intervals than the models accounting for interactions, but does not
affect interpretation.

Random sequence generation (selection bias)

Low risk

Quote: “An independent statistician used Stata to generate a randomisation
list…”
Quote: "Participants shall be randomized to a treatment arm at their baseline
visit. They will be randomized to the intervention or control (1:1 ratio) on the
basis of a computer-generated allocation sequence via the internet, with telephone backup, which will be provided by our electronic Primary Care Research
Network (ePCRN)."
Quote: "For very rare occasions when access to the network, and therefore
database randomization is not available, we will have a backup process involving sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes for randomization."

Blinding (performance
bias and detection bias)
All outcomes

High risk

No blinding
Quote: “open label trial so participants, research staff, and NHS Stop Smoking
Service personnel knew the arm to which participants were assigned.” Due to
UK clinical guidelines in place at the time of the study, stop smoking services
were less likely to prescribe varenicline to people in the intervention arm postquit than the control arm. Authors tested whether this difference between trial arms affected the study effect size and found that it did. As we have used
raw data for our NRT preloading meta-analysis and cannot control for this, we
deem this to be a high bias risk.
Groups received different common behavioural support initially. However, the
behavioural support in the control arm was designed to reduce bias by offering the same intensity of support in the absence of a placebo. It is not possible
to know whether this behavioural support was suitably matched, and therefore whether it was successful in minimising bias.

Methods

Study design: factorial RCT
Country: USA
Recruitment: smokers attending primary care clinics were invited to participate in a research programme to help them quit smoking. Electronic health record technology prompted clinic staff to invite
smokers to participate

Participants

544 smokers; aged ≥ 18 years, ≥ 5 cigarettes per day for 6 months, motivated to quit
41% men, average age 46.2, average cigarettes per day 18.6, mean FTND 4.9, HSI 3.2, baseline CO 18.5
ppm

Interventions

2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. There were 5 intervention components tested (detailed below) that
were tested in different combinations resulting in 32 study groups.
1) Nicotine patches and gum for 8 weeks starting on quit date versus nicotine patches and gum for 26
weeks starting on quit date
2) Maintenance counselling versus no maintenance counselling
3) Medication adherence counselling versus no medication adherence counselling
4) Automated adherence calls versus no adherence calls
5) Helping Hand medication dispenser with feedback and counselling versus no medication dispenser,
feedback or related counselling
For the purposes of this review, we are only interested in comparison 1.

Outcomes

Self-reported 7-day PPA at 52 weeks post-quit date
Validation: none
Other abstinence measures: self-reported 7-day PPA at 26 weeks post-quit date
Adverse events: measured at 1, 4 and 8 weeks by completed assessments with case managers (and at
16 weeks if receiving extended medication). Also measured at weeks 16, 26, 39 and 52 during follow-up
calls with assessors

Notes

The study was funded by grants 9P50CA143188 and 1K05CA139871 from the National Cancer Institute.
Conflicts of interest: "The authors have received no direct or indirect funding from, nor do they have a
connection with, the tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceutical or gaming industries or anybody funded substantially by one of these organizations. W.-Y.L. is supported partially by a grant from Eli Lilly and Company for research that is unrelated to smoking or tobacco dependence treatment."
This study has a factorial design and statistical interactions between factors were reported in the paper. Authors supplied group-by-group data. We checked to see if the odds ratios generated from these
raw data were significantly, clinically different from those generated for the regression model adjusting for interactions in the paper, for comparison 1. The odds ratios were similar, but the wider confidence intervals generated from the raw data changed the interpretation of the results. The analysis accounting for interactions in the paper resulted in a significant effect of 26-week gum, but this effect was
found to be non-significant when using raw data from the authors. We therefore have not entered raw
data, supplied by authors, into any analysis. We have reported this study narratively in the main text.

Despite differing dosing instructions between groups, no difference was observed: quote: “Two dosage
regimens were used, however, no difference was observed between the fixed and ad libitum dosing
group. With a mean daily dose of 16 mg nicotine, most subjects have in fact used the NNS [nicotine
nasal spray] once every hour as prescribed.”

Notes

Participants randomised to NRT selection box and 8 weeks of preferred NRT were mailed a 4-week free
supply of their chosen 1 or 2 NRT products after the selection box. They were then offered the option of
changing their choice of NRT at a 3-week follow-up call, prior to the second supply of 4 weeks free NRT
being sent out.
A very low proportion of participants who claimed to have quit completed verification (34%). We extracted actual verified rates and used these in our main analysis but conducted a sensitivity analysis
comparing these figures to data extrapolated from these proportions to the wider trial population, and
to non-verified rates. Results are reported narratively in the text.
Funding from Health Research Council of New Zealand and the Heart Foundation of New Zealand. NRT
was purchased for the intervention arm of the study from Novartis Consumer Health Australasia Pty Ltd
(patch and gum), and provided free by Johnson and Johnson Pacific (inhaler and sublingual tablet) and
Niconovum (oral pouch).

Study

Reason for exclusion

ACTRN12612001210864

All arms received the same NRT and instructions, but some were told that there were benefits of
long-term NRT use. Therefore, between-group differences were purely in the information provided.

Aubin 2006

Short-term experimental cross-over study of the effect of different types of nicotine patch on sleep
and smoking urges. Abstinence not measured and length of follow-up too short

Baker 2021

Despite the factorial study design, an intervention component (varenicline duration) was not balanced between studies arms with varying durations of NRT use.

Berlin 2012

Main comparator was the elective monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, EVT 302. Groups receiving NRT received the same dosing and administration across groups

Carpenter 2011

Measured effect of providing NRT samples on participants not initially motivated to quit. Participants were encouraged but not required to make a practice quit attempt. Intervention participants
were provided with up to 2 boxes of nicotine lozenges.

Chan 2010

Measured effect of counselling plus 2 weeks of free NRT. No data on whether control group also
used NRT; unclear if outcome due to counselling or free NRT

Cook 2016

Participants were not motivated or were unwilling to quit at recruitment, or both.

Cook 2021

Participants were not motivated or were unwilling to quit at recruitment, or both.

Dey 1999

Compared free and paid prescription for nicotine patch. Only 14 weeks follow-up

Etter 2009

Differences in the behavioural intervention (not just NRT) between arms, making it impossible to
attribute any effect to use of NRT. For this reason, the study does not meet review inclusion criteria.
It was included in Stead 2012, but has been removed for this update.

Fagerström 1993

Short-term cross-over trial. Endpoint was withdrawal symptoms not cessation

Fagerström 1997

Short-term cross-over trial of different types of NRT. For 2 weeks, participants could choose a
method; for other 2 weeks, they were randomly assigned to 1 of gum, patch, spray, inhaler or
tablet. Smoking reduction assessed

Fagerström 2000

Short-term cross-over trial comparing 2 nicotine delivery devices

Ferguson 2015

Standard nicotine patch treatment versus pre-quit patch versus varenicline. Follow-up of fewer
than 6 months (10 weeks)

Hajek 1999

Follow-up of fewer than 6 months. There were no significant differences in 12-week abstinence
rates between gum, patch, spray or inhaler groups.

Haustein 2003

Trial of nicotine gum for smoking reduction in people not making a quit attempt. See Cochrane Review of harm reduction interventions (Lindson-Hawley 2016)

Hollands 2013

Intervention was informing participants that their oral NRT dose was matched to their phenotype
versus genotype; NRT dose was actually the same across groups

Hughes 1989

No long-term follow-up; primarily a trial of the effect of instructions

Hughes 2010

Differences in the behavioural intervention (not just NRT) between arms, making it impossible to
attribute any effect to use of NRT. For this reason, study does not meet review inclusion criteria. It
was included in Stead 2012, but has been removed for this update.

Review findings

Patch duration

“Individuals who smoke more than 10 cigarettes daily
should apply a high-strength patch daily for 6 - 8 weeks,
followed by the medium-strength patch for 2 weeks and
then the low-strength patch for the final 2 weeks; individuals who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes daily can usually
start with the medium-strength patch for 6 - 8 weeks, followed by the low-strength patch for 2 - 4 weeks”

Low-certainty evidence of no effect of duration of nicotine patch use on smoking cessation.

> 10 cigarettes per day: 10 to 12 weeks

Studies in the review typically recruited
smokers who were smoking at least 15 cigarettes per day so comparisons with BNF
guidance for individuals smoking < 10 cigarettes per day cannot be made.

< 10 cigarettes per day: 8 to 12 weeks
Patch dose

“Individuals who smoke more than 10 cigarettes daily
should apply a high-strength patch… individuals who
smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes daily can usually start with
the medium-strength patch…”

> 10 cigarettes per day: high strength (21/22/25 mg) then
tapered
< 10 cigarettes per day: medium strength (15 mg) then tapered

Moderate-certainty evidence that 21 mg
patches result in higher quit rates than 14
mg 24-hour patches

Moderate-certainty evidence that 25 mg
patches result in higher quit rates than 15
mg (16-hour) patches, though the CI includes one.

Moderate-certainty evidence that 42/44 mg
patches (not available in UK) are as effective
as 21/22 mg patches

Low-certainty evidence of no difference of
dose on serious adverse events or treatment
withdrawals

Studies in the review typically recruited

Patch tapering

“Individuals who smoke more than 10 cigarettes daily
should apply a high-strength patch daily for 6-8 weeks,
followed by the medium-strength patch for 2 weeks and
then the low-strength patch for the final 2 weeks; individuals who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes daily can usually start with the medium-strength patch for 6-8 weeks, followed by the low-strength patch for 2-4 weeks”

No evidence of difference between tapering
and abrupt patch cessation on abstinence

Studies in the review typically recruited
smokers who were smoking at least 15 cigarettes per day so comparisons with BNF
guidance for individuals smoking < 10 cigarettes per day cannot be made.

> 10 cigarettes per day: 6 to 8 weeks high strength, 2
weeks medium strength, 2 weeks low strength
< 10 cigarettes per day: 6 to 8 weeks medium strength, 2
to 4 weeks low strength
Patch 16-hour versus
24-hour

No reference to hours of use per day

No evidence of effect of hours of use per day
on abstinence.

Ceasing versus continuing on lapse

“[If] abstinence is not achieved, or if withdrawal symptoms are experienced, the strength of the patch used
should be maintained or increased until the patient is stabilised”

No evidence of effect on abstinence of instructing participants to continue using
a patch versus stopping patch use, in the
event of a smoking lapse.

Continue on lapse
Patch preloading

No specific reference but does refer to using patch prior to
quit day to reduce cigarette consumption:

Moderate-certainty evidence of a positive effect of NRT preloading on abstinence

“a slower titration schedule can be used [for patches] in
individuals who are not ready to quit but want to reduce
cigarette consumption before a quit attempt”
Combination NRT

No reference to combination NRT

High-certainty evidence that combination
NRT results in higher long-term quit rates,
whether combination therapy was compared to patch or to a fast-acting form of
NRT.
Low- to very low-certainty evidence of no effect on cardiac adverse events, serious adverse events or study withdrawals

Type of NRT

Very low-certainty evidence of no difference in effect of type of fast-acting NRT (oral
spray, gum or inhaler) on smoking cessation
Gum dose

“In individuals who smoke fewer than 20 cigarettes each
day… 2 mg as required, chew 1 piece of gum when the
urge to smoke occurs or to prevent cravings”
“In individuals who smoke more than 20 cigarettes each
day or who require more than 15 pieces of 2 mg strength
gum each day… 4 mg as required, chew 1 piece of gum
when the urge to smoke occurs or to prevent cravings, individuals should not exceed 15 pieces of 4 mg strength
gum daily”

Evidence that using 4 mg gum results in
higher quit rates than 2 mg gum.

A post hoc subgroup analysis found a statistically significant benefit of 4 mg dose over
2 mg dose for higher-dependency smokers,
but not for lower-dependency smokers.

> 20 cigarette a day: 4 mg
< 20 cigarette a day: 2 mg
Duration of gum

“Treatment should continue for 3 months before reducing
the dose”

No significant effect of 50 weeks gum over
10 weeks gum use on smoking cessation

Fixed dose versus ad
lib dosing for fast-acting NRT

Gum: “Chew 1 piece of gum when the urge to smoke occurs or to prevent cravings”

No evidence of an effect of fixed versus ad
lib dosing of fast-acting NRT (gum and nasal
spray) on abstinence

Sublingual tablet: “1 [or 2] tablet[s] every 1 hour”
Inhalator: “As required, the cartridges can be used when
the urge to smoke occurs or to prevent cravings”
Lozenges: “1 lozenge every 1-2 hours as required, one
lozenge should be used when the urge to smoke occurs”
Oromucosal spray: “1-2 sprays as required, individuals
can spray in the mouth when the urge to smoke occurs or
to prevent cravings”
Nasal spray: “1 spray as required, individuals can spray into each nostril when the urge to smoke occurs, up to twice
every hour for 16 hours daily...maximum 64 sprays per
day.”

Advice differs by type of fast-acting NRT. Ad lib for gum

1. Introduction
1.1 The Tobacco Control Plan
In July 2017, the government published its Tobacco Control Plan for England
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobaccocontrol-plan-for-england), to pave the way for a smokefree generation. The

comprehensive plan sets out the following national ambitions for achievement by
the end of 2022.
1. To reduce smoking prevalence among adults in England from 15.5% to 12% or
less.
2. To reduce the prevalence of 15 year olds who regularly smoke from 8% to 3% or
less.
3. To reduce the prevalence of smoking in pregnancy from 10.7% to 6% or less.
4. To reduce the inequality gap in smoking prevalence between those in routine
and manual occupations and the general population.
The UK is a world leader in tobacco control, but smoking remains our biggest
preventable killer. In England alone, 78,000 people a year - or 200 per day - die
from smoking. In addition to the human cost, smoking costs the economy £14.7
billion per year, £2.5 billion of which falls to the NHS.
Since publication of the last Tobacco Control Plan, smoking prevalence among
adults in England has dropped from 20.2% to 14.9% - the lowest level since
records began.
The new plan sets out the ambition for a further reduction in smoking rates, down
to 12% by the end of 2022, as the first step toward a generation of non-smokers,
which will be achieved when smoking prevalence is at 5% or below.
The plan prioritises reducing the rates of smoking in pregnancy, as well as
addressing the huge variation in harm across the country, which disproportionally
falls on the more disadvantaged communities. In 2015, there were almost 3 times
as many smokers among the lowest earners in comparison to the highest earners.
The plan calls for targeting prevention and local action to address the variation in
smoking rates in our society, educate people about the risks and support them to
quit for good.
In June 2018, the government published Tobacco control plan: delivery plan 2017
to 2022 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tobacco-control-plan-delivery-plan2017-to-2022). The delivery plan makes it clear that helping smokers to quit is the
job of the whole health and care system.

1.2 The benefits of having a comprehensive approach to
tobacco control

Comprehensive tobacco control interventions, implemented at a local level and
part of a strategic partnership approach, reduce smoking prevalence and have
been proved effective in reducing social and health inequalities. Having a
comprehensive approach to tobacco control can help with the following things.
Cut costs to local business, healthcare and public services
Action on Smoking and Health (http://ash.org.uk/category/information-andresources/local-resources/) estimates that in England each year smoking costs
society £12.6 billion in terms of output lost from early deaths, smoking breaks, sick
days, provision of NHS treatment, provision of social care, household fires, and
smoking litter.
Support the NHS sustainability and transformation agenda
Smoking is a leading cause of preventable illness and tackling it presents a major
opportunity to make services across the entire health and care system more
sustainable.
Protect children from harm
The Office of National Statistics
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/inc
omeandwealth/compendium/generallifestylesurvey/2013-0307/chapter1smokinggenerallifestylesurveyoverviewareportonthe2011generallifestylesurvey)

found that two thirds of smokers say they began smoking before the age of 18,
when it’s legal to purchase cigarettes, and 9 out of 10 began before the age of 19.
Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at much greater risk of cot death,
meningitis, lung infections and ear disease - see ‘Passive smoking and children’
(https://shop.rcplondon.ac.uk/products/passive-smoking-and-children), a report by the
Tobacco Advisory Group of the Royal College of Physicians, published March
2010.
Boost the disposable income of the poorest people in your local area
Two adult smokers with a 20-a-day habit are likely to spend over £6,000 per year
on cigarettes. According to ASH, workers in routine and manual jobs are twice as
likely to smoke (http://ash.org.uk/information-and-resources/briefings/ash-briefing-healthinequalities-and-smoking/) as those in managerial and professional roles and poorer
smokers spend 5 times as much of their weekly household budget on smoking as
richer smokers (http://ash.org.uk/information-and-resources/fact-sheets/the-economics-oftobacco/).
Improve population health indicators
Reducing smoking rates will have an effect on core indicators included in 3 out of
the 4 public health domains identified in the Public Health Outcomes Framework
(https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework). Examples of
indicators which would be positively affected include:

sickness absence
the number of children in poverty
numbers of low birth-weight babies
pregnant women smoking at time of delivery
smoking prevalence rates in adults and children
infant mortality and all cause preventable mortality
mortality from cardiovascular disease
mortality from cancer
mortality from respiratory disease
preventable sight loss

1.3 Local systems
You need to have effective local systems to move the tobacco control agenda
forward. So it’s vital to make sure that all partner agencies involved in local tobacco
control activity have an opportunity to contribute to the needs assessment process
and assessing any further action that might be needed.
Formal strategic partnerships for tobacco control should involve all the relevant
stakeholders and agencies (such as acute health, mental health, public health,
regulatory services, employment, social care, children’s services, fire and rescue
service and criminal justice). The aim of the partnership is to develop an integrated
and comprehensive system for preventing smoking uptake, supporting smokers to
stop, reducing the harm and inequalities caused by smoking and advocating for a
tobacco-free generation.
Sustainability and transformation plans and integrated care systems
(https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/) should identify the role of tobacco control
in reducing health inequalities and improving sustainability. Local partners can
identify the potential return on investment for funding tobacco control interventions,
including any economies of scale from commissioning services between more than
one local authority. - see the NICE tobacco return on investment tool
(https://www.nice.org.uk/About/What-we-do/Into-practice/Return-on-investmenttools/Tobacco-Return-on-Investment-tool).

1.4 Aim of this guidance
PHE supports local authorities to deliver locally-appropriate interventions and
services to improve the public’s health, by providing data, guidance and evidence.
This guidance, along with the data packs that are sent directly to local authorities,
supports local needs assessment processes and commissioning of tobacco control
interventions. It also introduces a model from behaviour change theory, to support
commissioners to do a systematic analysis of their available commissioning
options.

Local authorities and their partners are also encouraged to adopt CLeaR
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-control-assessment/theclear-improvement-model-excellence-in-tobacco-control#clear-deep-dives), an evidence-

based improvement model which can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of local
action addressing harm from tobacco.

2. Commissioning comprehensive local
tobacco control interventions
2.1 Statement of principle
Local authority public health commissioners work closely with all relevant partners
to commission high quality, evidence-led comprehensive tobacco control
interventions.

2.2 What we mean by ‘evidence-led’
Tobacco control is an area of public health that has a very strong and consistent
evidence base. If recommended interventions are delivered, the evidence indicates
clearly that they will save lives and reduce chronic ill-health and disability, providing
net savings to the local and national economy within a few years.
The main drivers of reduction in smoking prevalence are decreasing uptake and
increasing cessation. By far the biggest impact on smoking prevalence in any one
year comes from increasing cessation simply because the numbers affected are so
much greater. So it is more cost effective to focus resources on smoking cessation.
An added advantage of this is that many interventions that promote cessation,
such as raising the cost of smoking, also serve to reduce smoking uptake.
The evidence comes from large numbers of population-level and clinical studies.
They demonstrate that, for smoking cessation to happen, smokers need to have
the capability, opportunity and motivation to change. All three of these need to be in
place. This broad principle has been captured by the COM-B
(https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-6-42) model
of behaviour.
Figure 1 shows the COM-B model applied to smoking cessation in a given
population or sub-population (for example, low income smokers, smokers with
mental health problems or pregnant smokers).
Capability refers to smokers’ ability to stop if they try. This depends on their level of
addiction to cigarettes. Most smokers are addicted to some degree, so treating the
addiction will improve their chances of success. Some smokers are much more
heavily addicted than others and it is essential that these people have access to
specialist support.

Motivation refers to smokers’ desire to try to stop now rather than at some other
time or never. Creating a sense of immediacy and hope are important in prompting
quit attempts. Examples include:
social marketing via mass media, social media and other platforms – these are
leading factors in motivating a person to quit, working by reminding them about
quitting, the best ways to do it, and prompting a quit attempt
minimising access to cheap tobacco – this supports one of the main influences
for quitting: the financial cost
brief advice from a healthcare professional – this is still one of the most
important triggers to quitting, especially if it involves the offer of support
Opportunity refers to reducing triggers to smoke, making smoking seem less
normal and making quitting seem like the kind of thing everyone is doing. Setting
up and enforcing smoking bans in key locations can play a role in this, as can
ensuring compliance with bans on marketing and promotion.
Figure 1: The COM-B model of behaviour change applied to reducing
smoking prevalence

The COM-B model of behaviour change applied to reducing smoking prevalence
There is a high level of interaction between these elements, emphasising the need
for comprehensive local tobacco control action plans. Improving smokers’ ability to
stop can increase their motivation to try, as can decreasing smoking triggers in
their environment and increasing public visibility of quitting.

The most effective tobacco control strategy is one in which all the elements are
working together. This means, for example, linking up social marketing campaigns
prompting quitting with brief advice from health professionals offering support. An
integrated strategy requires multi-agency working with a clear and coherent vision
as to the local objectives and how the different elements of the strategy will
combine to achieve these.

2.3 What will you see locally if you are meeting the
principle?
Effective integrated commissioning of interventions that achieve positive outcomes
for individuals, families and communities by:
having well-functioning partnerships between local authority-led public health,
the NHS (clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and NHS England regional
teams), acute health services, mental health services and adult social care,
regulatory services, children’s services and criminal justice agencies
commissioning transparently, based on assessed need
bringing partner agencies and service providers together into cost-effective
delivery systems
involving service users and local communities, including through Healthwatch
(https://www.healthwatch.co.uk/)

All smokers are offered cessation support suited to their needs and preferences.
Tobacco control is a prominent action within strategies aimed at addressing health
and social inequalities.

2.4 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Embedding in local systems
Do tobacco control needs assessments, the local authority commissioning strategy,
CCG commissioning strategy, the joint health and wellbeing strategy and
sustainability and transformation plans (STPs) show an explicit link between
evidence of need and service planning?
Are there suitable mechanisms in place within the local public health structure to
ensure the impact of tobacco use is reported to the health and wellbeing board and
STP delivery boards?
Have the people responsible for commissioning tobacco control and stop smoking
services established partnership arrangements with CCGs, local clinical networks,
the local maternity system, NHS England regional teams, regulatory services and
criminal justice agencies?

Has the role of tobacco control in supporting the NHS sustainability and
transformation agenda been formally explored?
Have such strategic partnerships undertaken a self-assessment
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-control-assessment) to

enable you to:
evaluate your local action on tobacco
ensure that local activity follows the latest evidence-based practice
identify priority areas for development
Have strategic partner organisations acknowledged their responsibilities to protect
their tobacco control policies from the vested interests of the tobacco industry
under Article 5.3 of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control (http://www.who.int/fctc/en/), by signing the Local Government
Declaration on Tobacco Control (http://smokefreeaction.org.uk/declarationsindex-html/)?
Is there a clearly accessible process for smokers to express their preferences for
how they want to stop smoking and the type of support they are willing to engage
with?
Needs assessment
Needs assessment involves not just assessing whether smokers in particular subgroups would benefit from cessation support, but also what kind of support, if any,
they are willing to engage with.
Does the local needs assessment include a comprehensive section on tobacco
control that addresses smoking-related harm and health inequalities, and
acknowledges the impact of tobacco control activity across the Public Health
Outcomes Framework (https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomesframework) and NHS Outcomes Framework
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-outcomes-framework-2013-to-2014)?
Is there a shared understanding of the local level of demand and need, based on a
range of local and national data across a range of public services?
Is local data on tobacco control interventions provided within hospitals, primary
health care and other settings collected and analysed to inform needs
assessment?
Does analysis of tobacco-related hospital admissions inform the targeting of local
interventions?
Do commissioners own and analyse local stop smoking service treatment data to
assess quality, including specific breakdown by gender, age, postcode, condition,
route of referral and treatment outcome, so that treatment provision can be aligned
with need?
Does the needs assessment incorporate a methodology such as asset-based
community development to take into account the availability and potential for

development of existing community support networks and other local assets?
Have you identified:
gaps in the delivery of brief interventions across all partner agencies
the equity of access to stop smoking services for populations with a higher
prevalence of smoking (such as routine and manual workforce, teenage
pregnant women, people with mental health problems, prison populations and
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people)
the impact of tobacco control and stop smoking interventions on hospital
admissions, length of stay and social care activity
Resources and investment
Is investment equal to the level of identified need and sufficient for a range of
prevention, harm reduction and stop smoking service activities?
Can commissioners identify the total level of local investment by all partners who
contribute to delivering services?
Have the partners identified the potential return on investment for funding tobacco
control interventions and does this include any economies of scale that could be
achieved by commissioning with other local authorities? See the NICE return on
investment tool (https://www.nice.org.uk/About/What-we-do/Into-practice/Return-oninvestment-tools/Tobacco-Return-on-Investment-tool).
Effective commissioning
Do interventions commissioned for tobacco control and tackling smoking-related
harm take an evidence-based approach based on NICE guidance
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/lifestyle-and-wellbeing/smoking-and-tobacco#panelpathways) and National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/) (NCSCT) commissioning recommendations?

Are reliable cost-effectiveness data tools used to inform commissioning decisions
and ensure that investment in tobacco control is based on an understanding of
expenditure, performance and effectiveness?
Do contracts for commissioned services specify performance indicators and are
these regularly monitored and reviewed?
Are interventions and services geographically and culturally appropriate to the
people for whom they are designed?
Is there sufficient tobacco control commissioning capacity and expertise?
Are arrangements in place to enable commissioning with regional partners?
Does formal evaluation of the range of tobacco control interventions feature in the
commissioning strategy?

3. Supporting people to stop smoking
3.1 Statement of principle
Targeted stop smoking services, as an integral part of any comprehensive tobacco
control strategy, provide evidence-based support tailored to the needs and
preferences of smokers.

3.2 Local stop smoking services
Stop smoking services are an important component of cost-effective tobacco
control strategies at local and national level. Targeted, high quality stop smoking
services are essential to the reduction of health inequalities in local populations.
For many years, smokers in England have been offered a highly effective universal
service. In recent years, some local authorities have been looking at new ways of
providing this service, often in response to budget constraints.
It is important to ensure that resources are appropriately targeted, and that
commissioning decisions are based on the evidence of what works and avoid
selectively disadvantaging the local population.
All health and social care services play a role in identifying smokers and referring
them to stop smoking services. For smokers who are not ready, willing or able to
stop in one step, harm reduction interventions can support them in becoming
smokefree over the longer term.

3.3 The need for tailored quitting support within a
comprehensive strategy
The probability of one-year success of an unaided quit attempt is typically less than
5%. That is a main reason why smoking prevalence is falling very slowly despite
the fact that a third of smokers try to stop every year.
Failure to quit attempts is also why prevalence is declining more slowly in people
with greater social disadvantage. In the recent past there has been no difference in
the rate at which more disadvantaged smokers try to stop. It is their chances of
success that are lower - see the BMJ research paper on the social gradient in
smoking cessation (https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/18/1/43).
Smokers who get expert support from stop smoking services are up to 4 times as
likely to quit successfully as those who try to quit unaided according to the National
Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_Stop_smoking_services_impact_on_quitting.php). So
support for smoking cessation is a crucial part of tobacco control at national and
local level, and essential for reducing health inequalities caused by smoking. As
noted in Chapter 1, it is important to link stop smoking support with other
components of the local tobacco control strategy so that:

smokers are motivated to try to stop and use effective methods to do so
increasing ability to stop increases motivation to stop
stopping smoking becomes more visible in the community (see figure 2)
Figure 2: The role of stop-smoking support in a comprehensive strategy

Making sure that cessation support is available helps to: (1) tackle cigarette
addiction, (2) which increases cessation rates and (3), can motivate others to quit,
and (4) to use cessation support. Increased successful quitting in the community
reshapes the social environment (5) making quitting normative and potentially
helping to motivate others to quit (6).

3.4 Smoking cessation within integrated lifestyle services
There is a pressing need for broader lifestyle advice and support, with issues such
as healthy weight and physical activity becoming more prominent. This has led
some local authorities to commission lifestyle services and to incorporate stop
smoking support into these.
Broadly, 2 different models for integrating services have emerged and it is
important to distinguish between them. One involves an umbrella organisation,
which directs people to specific treatment programmes, such as stop smoking
support with evidence based behavioural support and pharmacotherapy. The other
provides a more generic multi-behaviour change intervention, that may include
smoking.

It is essential that commissioning decisions take account of the large body of
evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different approaches. The
NCSCT has reviewed this literature and provided recommendations
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_lifestyle_services_briefing.php). It concludes that
smoking cessation is most effective and cost-effective when provided as a single
intervention, rather than as part of multi-component integrated lifestyle
interventions. The evidence associated with different components and models for
providing stop smoking interventions is summarised in this PHE models of delivery
guidance (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stop-smoking-services-models-ofdelivery).

3.5 Harm reduction and the role of e-cigarettes in
supporting smokers to quit
The best thing a smoker can do is to stop smoking now, completely and for good.
However not all smokers are ready, willing or able to stop in one step and NICE
tobacco harm reduction guidance PH45 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45) sets
out a series of approaches that support smokers to quit in the longer term, while
reiterating that abrupt quitting is the best option.
1. Stopping smoking and using one or more licensed nicotine-containing products
as long as needed to prevent relapse.
2. Cutting down prior to stopping smoking with or without the help of licensed
nicotine-containing products.
3. Smoking reduction with or without the help of licensed nicotine-containing
products.
4. Temporary abstinence
(http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/PH45/chapter/glossary#temporary-abstinence) from
smoking with or without the help of licensed nicotine-containing products.
NICE guidance on tobacco harm reduction is currently under review and will be
updated to include recommendations on consumer and licensed e-cigarettes.
There is growing evidence that harm reduction approaches may play a role in
complementing conventional cessation-focused strategies. In the context of
tobacco control in the UK, harm reduction involves:
advising smokers who are not ready to quit that they should try to reduce their
smoking with the aid of a nicotine substitute
recognising that smokers who have stopped smoking with the aid of a nicotine
substitute may need to continue to use that substitute for months or years to
prevent relapse to smoking
Stop smoking services (http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/PH45/chapter/glossary#stopsmoking-services-2) provide highly cost-effective interventions to help people stop
smoking and any investment in harm reduction should not detract from providing
them. Harm reduction interventions are intended to support and extend the reach
and impact of existing services.

Although existing evidence is not clear regarding the health benefits of smoking
reduction (http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/PH45/chapter/glossary#smoking-reduction)
alone, people who reduce the amount they smoke are more likely to stop smoking
eventually, particularly if they are using licensed nicotine-containing products
(http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/PH45/chapter/glossary#licensed-nicotine-containingproducts).

An estimated 2.9 million adults in Britain currently use e-cigarettes (vape). Over
time, the proportion of vapers who smoke tobacco has fallen and the proportion
who are ex-smokers has risen, while regular e-cigarette use among people who
have never smoked has remained negligible at 0.3%, according to ASH’s report on
‘Use of e-cigarettes among adults in Great Britain, 2018’
(http://ash.org.uk/information-and-resources/fact-sheets/use-of-e-cigarettes-among-adultsin-great-britain-2017/). The latest data from Action on Smoking and Health
(http://ash.org.uk/download/ash-factsheet-use-of-e-cigarette-among-adults-in-great-britain2018) shows that 1.7 million vapers – over half of the total – have managed to stop

smoking completely - and ONS figures
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifee
xpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2017) suggest that more than

900,000 people have given up both smoking and vaping. This suggests that for
many smokers, dual use (vaping while continuing to smoke) may be a stage in
their journey to becoming smokefree and, ultimately, nicotine free.
Leading UK health and public health organisations including the Royal College of
General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK
now agree that although they are not risk free, e-cigarettes are far less harmful
than smoking. Based on an assessment of the available international peerreviewed evidence, Public Health England
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-and-heated-tobacco-productsevidence-review) and the Royal College of Physicians
(https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/nicotine-without-smoke-tobacco-harmreduction-0) estimate the risk reduction to be at least 95%. In 2018 so far, 3 major

US reports (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, American
Cancer Society and the US Annual Review of Public Health) have found that ecigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking.
The UK has some of the strictest regulation for e-cigarettes in the world. Under the
Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016
(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/507/contents/made), e-cigarette products are
subject to minimum standards of quality and safety, as well as packaging and
labelling requirements to provide consumers with the information they need to
make informed choices. All e-cigarette products must be notified by manufacturers
to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
(https://www.gov.uk/guidance/e-cigarettes-regulations-for-consumer-products), with
detailed information including the listing of all ingredients.
E-cigarettes are now the most commonly used stop smoking aid in England,
according to Smoking in England data (http://www.smokinginengland.info/). Evidence
for their effectiveness from research trials

(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub3/abstract) is

currently limited but suggests that it is broadly similar to prescribed stop smoking
medicines and more effective than licensed nicotine products if these are used
without any professional support. Smokers who combine e-cigarettes with support
from stop smoking services in England have some of the highest quit rates. In the
financial year 2017 to 2018, around two thirds of smokers who did this quit
smoking successfully according to NHS Digital figures (https://digital.nhs.uk/data-andinformation/publications/statistical/statistics-on-nhs-stop-smoking-services-in-england/april2017-to-march-2018).

E-cigarettes cannot be prescribed to smokers as part of stop smoking
interventions, as there are currently no medicinally licensed products available on
the market. However some services provide e-cigarette starter packs, increasing
footfall and improving quit rates. Clear advice on the benefits and risks should be
included in optimal self-support, and stop smoking services should welcome
smokers who want to use an e-cigarette to help them quit.
NICE guidance NG92 ‘Stop smoking interventions and services’
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng92) recommends that health and social care
professionals provide the following advice to smokers who are using, or interested
in using, an e-cigarette for quitting. The guidance says that:
although these products are not licensed medicines, they are regulated by the
Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016
many people have found them helpful to quit smoking cigarettes
people using e-cigarettes should stop smoking tobacco completely, because any
smoking is harmful
the evidence suggests that e cigarettes are substantially less harmful to health
than smoking but are not risk free
the evidence in this area is still developing, including evidence on the long-term
health impact
Further guidance is available from the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and
Training (http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_electronic_cigarette_briefing.php) (NCSCT).

3.6 What you will see if you are meeting the principle
In line with NICE guidance (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng92), service providers
should treat at least 5% of their local smoking population and see the following
indicators in their area:
Stop smoking services achieve exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) validated success
rates comparable to areas with similar smoker profiles and within the nationally
prescribed range.
Stop smoking support is routinely offered, and made easily accessible, to
vulnerable populations and those identified as at risk in the needs assessment.

All licensed stop smoking medications are available as first-line treatment options,
especially dual form nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (for example, nicotine
transdermal patch plus a faster acting product), and varenicline.
People who are using or want to use e-cigarettes to stop smoking receive advice
and behavioural support from their local stop smoking service.
Services are independently audited and improvement plans are implemented
where required.
There are clear and efficient referral pathways embedded throughout health and
social care services and these are routinely used to promote stop smoking
services.
Services are promoted locally through mass media channels to raise awareness of
the support available for people who want to stop smoking.
There is simple, easy-to-use online information for smokers to get information
about the stop smoking support available in their area, the benefits of using each of
the options, the commitment required for each and how to access them.
The role of stop smoking support in the local tobacco control strategy is clearly set
out, quantifying how it is expected to contribute to reducing overall smoking
prevalence and in different sub-populations.
All required monitoring data is reported to NHS Digital (https://digital.nhs.uk/data-andinformation/publications/statistical/statistics-on-nhs-stop-smoking-services-in-england)

through the quarterly reporting system.
Smokers who are not ready, willing, or able to stop in one step are advised and
supported to use a licensed nicotine-containing product or an e-cigarette to help
them reduce their smoking with a view to stopping in the future.
Ex-smokers who feel they need to continue to use a nicotine substitute long term to
avoid relapse to smoking are encouraged to do so.

3.7 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Is there a clear specification of how stop smoking support integrates with other
parts of the local tobacco control strategy to increase the capability, motivation and
opportunity of smokers to quit?
Is service design and delivery informed by the latest evidence, summarised in the
NCSCT service delivery and monitoring guidance
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_service_and_delivery_guidance_2014.php)?
Has an equity impact and gap analysis been carried out and do commissioning
priorities reflect it?

Have all stop smoking practitioners been trained to NCSCT standards
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_ncsct-training-standard-learning-outcomes-for-trainingstop-smoking-practitioners.php)?

Are all licensed stop smoking medicines offered as first-line interventions, including
dual form NRT and varenicline?
Is stop smoking support offered to smokers who want to use e-cigarettes
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_electronic_cigarette_briefing.php) in their quit
attempt?
Have priority sub-populations been identified and do those in greatest need of
specialist support (such as smokers with mental health problems, pregnant
smokers and those from disadvantaged backgrounds) have good access to it?
Are 4-week quit outcomes collected as specified in the NCSCT service and
delivery guidance
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_service_and_delivery_guidance_2014.php) validated
biochemically by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide and is the full data set
submitted quarterly to NHS Digital (https://digital.nhs.uk/)?
Does the commissioner own all the monitoring data and have the capacity to
undertake independent audits and performance monitoring when they need to?
Are stop smoking service providers subject to annual independent audit?
Are stop smoking services commissioned to promote available stop smoking
interventions, to the public and to health professionals, including use of appropriate
referral pathways?
Does the local tobacco control strategy include a clear specification of how harm
reduction approaches will be used to complement stop-smoking support?
Are smokers who are not ready to try to quit advised to use a licensed nicotine
product or an e-cigarette to reduce their smoking, with a view to quitting at a later
date?
Are ex-smokers encouraged to use a nicotine substitute for as long as they feel
they need them to prevent relapse to smoking?

4. Supporting pregnant smokers and those
with infants to stop smoking
4.1 Statement of principle
All women who smoke and are pregnant, planning a pregnancy and have an infant
should be referred for help to stop smoking.

4.2 Reducing smoking in pregnancy is an urgent priority

Smoking during pregnancy (http://ash.org.uk/information-and-resources/reportssubmissions/reports/smoking-cessation-in-pregnancy-a-review-of-the-challenge-2/) causes

up to 2,200 premature births, 5,000 miscarriages and 300 perinatal deaths every
year in the UK. It also increases the risks of stillbirth and of the child developing
respiratory disease; attention and hyperactivity difficulties; learning difficulties;
problems of the ear, nose and throat; obesity; and diabetes.
Addressing smoking in pregnancy should be a focus for all localities as this
impacts on a range of issues related to health, inequalities and child development.
NICE has produced guidance on how best to support women to stop smoking in
pregnancy (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph26).
Although rates have declined over the last decade, 10.8% of women in England
were recorded as smoking at the time of delivery in 2017 to 2018, which represents
the second consecutive year with no progress. This NHS digital data
(http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180328134804/http://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/P
UB24222) translates into over 64,000 babies born to smoking mothers each year.

There are significant demographic differences and inequalities related to this issue.
For instance, pregnant mothers under the age of 20 are 6 times as likely to smoke
as mothers aged 35 or over. Those in routine and manual occupations are more
than 4 times as likely as those in managerial and professional occupations to
smoke throughout pregnancy (29% and 7% respectively). Infants born to smokers
are much more likely to become smokers themselves, which further perpetuates
health inequalities.
Treating mothers and their babies (0 to 12 months) who have problems caused by
smoking during pregnancy is estimated to cost the NHS between £20 million and
£87.5 million each year according to a Public Health Research Consortium report
(http://phrc.lshtm.ac.uk/papers/PHRC_A3-06_Final_Report.pdf).

4.3 Support is needed for pregnant smokers
Motivation to stop smoking is very high in pregnancy and by the time pregnant
smokers come into contact with healthcare services, many of those who can stop
by themselves will have done so. Using the COM-B model, there needs to be a
much greater emphasis on capability and opportunity. This may be expected to
boost motivation to try to stop and to persist with quit attempts in the face of
difficulties.
Pregnant women who continue to smoke should receive the highest quality stop
smoking support available based on evidence-based principles set out in NICE and
NCSCT guidance. The healthcare system should support broader strategies to
address this issue, creating a social environment in which smoking during
pregnancy is not normal, but quitting is. This requires repeated offers of support for
quitting, delivered in a way that inspires hope rather than making people feel guilty.
Relapse to smoking soon after the baby is born is very common, but can be
reduced by appropriate interventions from healthcare professionals working with
new mothers. This kind of support should form part of a comprehensive

programme commissioned by local authorities and embedded within the local
maternity system.

4.4 What you will see if you are meeting the principle
Smoking is addressed by all healthcare professionals working with pregnant
women throughout their pregnancy.
All pregnant women are screened for carbon monoxide (CO) at their booking
appointment, and at subsequent antenatal appointments. If elevated CO levels are
identified (indicating smoking) a referral is made to a specially trained pregnancy
stop smoking advisor for support to stop.
Robust, opt-out referral pathways are in place between the healthcare professional
(HCP) who raises the issue of smoking with the pregnant woman and the stop
smoking service or person trained to provide the intervention. This will include
feedback mechanisms to ensure the referring HCP is aware of the outcome.
Partners and family members who smoke are also offered support to stop smoking
and information is provided on the risks associated with secondhand smoke.

4.5 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Is NICE guidance (PH26) (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph26) appropriately
implemented across systems in your local area?
Do service specifications for local midwifery services include requirements for
smoking to be addressed?
Do these specifications include routine CO screening at booking appointments and
other appointments?
Are there appropriate performance indicators in place to monitor this activity, and
are there systems in place to address poor performance?
Are individuals who smoke provided with appropriate and consistent messages
around smoking, the risks of continuation and the importance of cessation, as well
as the risks associated with secondhand smoke?
Are there appropriate opt-out referral pathways in place, to make sure that women
with elevated CO levels have swift access to specialist support to stop smoking?
Are there effective feedback mechanisms to the referrer that provide information
and details for future follow-up?
Are all healthcare professionals who meet with pregnant women trained in very
brief advice for smoking in pregnancy (http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_very-briefadvice.php)enabling them to raise the issue of smoking and refer to specialist
services?

Are staff providing stop smoking interventions appropriately trained and does the
training meet NCSCT standards
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_briefing_for_midwifery_staff.php)?
Are stop smoking interventions provided on an ongoing basis and is information on
and access to stop smoking medications made available?
Is smoking status a mandatory data item collected at booking, including recording
of the CO reading?
Is smoking status at time of delivery (SATOD) monitored regularly within and
across the locality?
Does the system for SATOD data collection include the option of ‘not known?’ If
there is, are there plans to remove this and make sure there is more accurate and
informative data collection?
Is there a local multi-agency partnership in place with appropriate local leadership
to address the issue of smoking in pregnancy? Is there a strategy?
Is system-wide action to address smoking in pregnancy clearly specified within the
local maternity system?
Are contract specifications reviewed regularly? Is there a process for monitoring
delivery and outcomes?
Has the local authority undertaken a CLeaR deep dive review on smoking in
pregnancy (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-controlassessment), involving all relevant partners?

5. Smokefree homes and cars
5.1 Statement of principle
Enclosed smokefree places or settings create an environment in which smoking is
less normal and protect the health of non-smoking children and adults.

5.2 Enclosed smokefree environments protect non-smokers
and promote quitting
Millions of children in the UK are still exposed to secondhand smoke that puts them
at increased risk of respiratory problems, meningitis and sudden unexplained infant
death, according to a Royal College of Physicians report ‘Passive smoking and
children’ (https://shop.rcplondon.ac.uk/products/passive-smoking-and-children?
variant=6634905477) published in 2010. Each year this results in over 300,000 GP
visits and around 9,500 hospital admissions in the UK and costs the NHS more
than £23.6 million.

Exposure to secondhand smoke in confined spaces such as a car is particularly
hazardous. Legislation introduced in October 2015 means it is now prohibited to
smoke in a vehicle with someone under the age of 18 present. As there is no safe
level of exposure to tobacco smoke, it is important that other vulnerable groups
such as older adults are also protected.
Reducing the visibility of smoking can be expected to make smoking less
normative, helping to support smokers who are in the process of quitting and
motivating other smokers to try to quit. This is an important contribution to a
comprehensive local approach to tobacco control.
Figure 3: Promoting smokefree homes and cars to promote successful
quitting

Smokefree homes and cars reduces visibility of smoking for the family and
promotes a wider non-smoking norm (1), which should trigger more quitting
behaviour (2) and also provide greater motivation to quit (3) which should also
promote more quitting behaviour (4).

5.3 What you will see if you are meeting the principle?
Frontline health and social care workers routinely ask service users if they are ever
exposed to tobacco smoke in an enclosed environment.
Frontline health and social care workers provide expert advice on how to make
homes and cars smokefree.

Local policies and plans are in place to increase enclosed smokefree spaces,
supporting smokers to create and maintain smokefree homes and cars..
Local partners are in a position to educate the public on compliance with
smokefree legislation (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-rules-abouttobacco-e-cigarettes-and-smoking-1-october-2015), including the prohibition of smoking
in a vehicle with someone under the age of 18 present.

5.4 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice?
Have early years partners undertaken an assessment of their capacity to deliver
brief interventions, advice about smoking cessation, and secondhand smoke
interventions?
Do frontline health and social care workers monitor and record smoking status?
Are there measures of exposure to secondhand smoke for vulnerable groups,
especially children?
Is there access to a freely available and evidence-based stop smoking service?
There are further questions in Section 2: Supporting people to stop smoking.
Have smoking cessation advisors and frontline health and social care workers
completed the NCSCT module (http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_secondhand-smoketraining-module.php) for very brief advice on secondhand smoke?
Does advice on secondhand smoke extend to cars, with and without under-18s
present, and other enclosed environments?
Do you have evidence that brief interventions on secondhand smoke are being
delivered?
Do you have evidence that commitments to smokefree homes and cars are being
adopted and maintained?

6. Preventing young people from taking up
smoking
6.1 Statement of principle
Positive influences in the school, home and local community prevent young people
from taking up smoking.

6.2 Reducing smoking uptake involves creating nonsmoking communities

Evidence suggests that a strong anti-smoking ethos in schools, families and the
wider community is important in preventing smoking uptake. ONS figures
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/inc
omeandwealth/compendium/generallifestylesurvey/2013-0307/chapter1smokinggenerallifestylesurveyoverviewareportonthe2011generallifestylesurvey)

show that the majority of smokers start while in their teenage years with very few
new smokers beginning after the age of 20.
Many factors contribute to an increased likelihood of young people starting to
smoke. School-based programmes have been found to have some effect in
reducing smoking uptake but may be limited if they are based on educational
approaches alone. Promoting a non-smoking community and reducing access to
tobacco for under-18 year olds are important to youth prevention.
The tobacco control plan for England
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobaccocontrol-plan-for-england) makes it clear that one of the most effective ways to reduce

the number of young people smoking is to reduce the number of adults who
smoke. Continuing to encourage adult smokers to quit must therefore remain an
important part of reducing prevalence amongst the young, and achieving a
smokefree generation.”
There is a separate commissioning support pack for young people’s drug, alcohol
and tobacco use (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-drugs-and-tobaccocommissioning-support-pack) that should be read alongside the principles and
questions in this guidance.

6.3 What you will see locally if you are meeting the principle
Every learning institution has a clear anti-smoking ethos that applies to everyone
who comes into contact with the institution.
Educational content implemented in learning environments ensures that young
people understand the short and long-term health, and the economic and societal
consequences of tobacco use. This can be achieved within the school curriculum.
Targeted peer mentoring programmes are implemented in areas of greater need.
A reduction in the availability and affordability of tobacco for young people see
Section 12: Tackling cheap and illicit tobacco.

6.4 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Does tobacco prevention work in schools follow the NICE evidence base
(https://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/PH23) by promoting a non-smoking community?
Do schools have a clear anti-smoking ethos that is backed by a clear policy on
tobacco?

Do schools include tobacco education as part of the curriculum?
Has consideration been given to using peer-led smoking prevention programmes?
Are frontline workers in schools and youth settings trained to discuss smoking with
young people?
Do you monitor compliance with retail legislation
(https://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/PH14) for tobacco?
Is training and information offered to retailers to maintain or strengthen compliance
with point of sales legislation?
Is your monitoring and enforcement of point of sale legislation intelligence-led?
Are systems in place to identify and report sales of illicit tobacco locally? Further
prompts are provided in Section 12: Tackling cheap and illicit tobacco.

7. Primary care
7.1 Statement of principle
Primary care remains a main source of evidence-based advice and support about
smoking and action must be properly integrated with other tobacco control
activities.

7.2 The continuing role for primary care
According to NICE (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng92), approximately 90% of
patient interaction with the healthcare system in England is with primary care
services. Smoking is responsible for many fatalities from cancer, respiratory and
circulatory disease but there are also many non-fatal diseases which are intensified
as a result of smoking. So it’s likely that a higher proportion of smokers will present
to primary care services, many of whom will have illnesses caused or aggravated
by smoking.
The majority of smokers want to quit and around a third make a quit attempt each
year. However success rates are low, as most use the least effective quitting
methods. There is a significant opportunity to direct smokers motivated to quit to
more effective methods of cessation, for their individual benefit and to support the
sustainability of services.

7.3 What will you see locally if you are meeting the
principle?
GPs identifying smokers, delivering very brief advice and following up, where
appropriate, with a referral into stop smoking services, in accordance with NICE

guidance NG92 ‘Stop smoking interventions and services
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng92)’.
GPs offering advice on using nicotine-containing products on general sale,
including NRT and e cigarettes, in accordance with NICE guidance NG92
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng92).
All evidence-based support options are available to smokers through primary care
and smokers are clear about what they involve and the benefits of each
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stop-smoking-options-guidance-forconversations-with-patients).

There are effective referral routes into specialist stop-smoking support.
As part of the NHS Health Check (http://www.healthcheck.nhs.uk/) for adults aged 40
to 74, all smokers are given advice and offered a referral to their local stop
smoking service.
Patients who decline support are advised to reduce their smoking with the aid of a
licensed nicotine product or, if they prefer, an e-cigarette.
All GPs have completed the NCSCT ‘Very brief advice on smoking’
(http://elearning.ncsct.co.uk/england) online training module.

7.4 Questions to check if you are following the evidence
and best practice
Is the smoking status of all patients known?
Are records routinely updated to ensure that the smoking status of all patients is
accurate?
Are all patients who smoke offered very brief advice on stopping smoking?
Are patients who smoke offered advice on using nicotine-containing products on
general sale, including NRT and e cigarettes?
Is there access to a freely available and evidence-based stop smoking service for
everyone who smokes or uses tobacco in any other form? Further prompts are
provided in Section 2: Supporting people to stop smoking.
Have any barriers to accessing stop smoking support been identified?
Is referral to a stop smoking service made where support is required?
Is referral recorded on the patient’s records and is the outcome of the intervention
recorded?
Have all in-house stop smoking practitioners been trained to NCSCT standards
(http://www.ncsct.co.uk/publication_ncsct-training-standard-learning-outcomes-for-trainingstop-smoking-practitioners.php)?

8. Secondary care
8.1 Statement of principle
Smokers attending secondary care (https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/hidingplain-sight-treating-tobacco-dependency-nhs) are usually in most urgent need of
encouragement and support to stop and should routinely be offered support.
Inpatients should be treated for their tobacco dependency and offered quit support
that continues after discharge.

8.2 Smoking cessation support should be integral to
secondary care
Stopping smoking at any time has considerable health benefits for people who
smoke and those around them. For people using secondary care services, there
are additional advantages. These include shorter hospital stays, lower drug doses,
fewer complications, higher survival rates, better wound healing, decreased
infections, and fewer re-admissions after surgery, according to the British Thoracic
Society’s report ‘The case for change’ (https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/documentlibrary/clinical-information/smoking-cessation/bts-case-for-change/),.
Secondary care providers have a duty of care to protect the health of people who
use or work in their services and to promote healthy behaviour among them. This
duty of care includes providing effective support to stop or abstain from smoking
while using or working in secondary care services (NICE guidance PH48
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/PH48)).

8.3 What you will see if you are meeting the principle
Smokers who attend secondary care settings are offered advice and support to
stop.
All hospitals have an onsite stop smoking service that provides intensive
behavioural support and pharmacotherapy as an integral component of secondary
care.
Integrated care pathways exist that allow for a seamless transition of care between
primary and secondary settings.
Stop smoking medicines are available on hospital formularies and available to
support people experiencing nicotine withdrawal when in hospital.
There are no designated smoking areas or smoking breaks allowed by staff for
anyone using secondary care services.
All secondary care estates are designated completely smokefree and the policy is
clearly communicated to all patients, staff and visitors.

Policies on e-cigarette use make a clear distinction between smoking and vaping,
and support smokers to quit smoking and stay smokefree while managing
identified risks.
Local tobacco control strategies include secondary care as a main point of contact
for smokers.

8.4 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Do local tobacco control strategies include secondary care? Do these strategies
employ contractual levers such as the Preventing ill health by risky behaviours –
alcohol and tobacco CQUIN (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-illhealth-commissioning-for-quality-and-innovation)?
Is information on the smoking policies and available stop smoking support provided
to patients before they enter secondary care?
Is there a mandatory training programme for all frontline healthcare staff to know
and use very brief stop smoking advice and, where possible, train in motivational
interviewing for behavioural change, to Make Every Contact Count (MECC)
(http://www.makingeverycontactcount.co.uk/)?
Do health and social care practitioners in all acute, maternity, public health and
mental health services – including community services, drug and alcohol services,
outpatient and pre-admission clinics – identify people who smoke and offer help to
stop?
Are people who are not willing or able to stop completely provided access to harm
reduction strategies and pharmacotherapies to support them?
Do hospital staff routinely provide information and advice for carers, family and
other household members and hospital visitors on the services available to help
them stop smoking?
Are all stop smoking medicines available as first-line treatment for people who are
in hospital?
Are referral systems in place that provide a prompt for action (including the referral
of people to stop smoking support) and that ensure smoking status is consistent in
all patient records? Are these records stored in a way that helps them to be easily
accessed and audited?
Do directors, senior managers and clinical leads provide leadership on stop
smoking support?
Do all secondary care sites have smokefree grounds or do they have a plan to
achieve this status within the next 6 months?
Are policies on e-cigarette use consistent with PHE advice
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-e-cigarettes-in-public-places-and-

workplaces)?

Do secondary care providers act as examples of best practice?
Are staff provided with support to stop smoking?
Has the local authority undertaken a CLeaR
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-control-assessment) deep

dive review of smoking in acute settings with all relevant partners?

9. Mental health
9.1 Statement of principle
A comprehensive tobacco control strategy provides high quality evidence-based
interventions to people who need it most.

9.2 Smoking and mental health problems
People with a mental health condition die on average 10 to 20 years earlier than
the general population. A joint report by the Royal College of Physicians and the
Royal College of Psychiatrists estimates that a third of all cigarettes smoked in
England are smoked by people with a mental health condition
(https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/usefulresources/publications/collegereports/cr/cr178.aspx).
Smoking among this population has changed little, if at all, over the past 20 years
and in 2014 to 2015, smoking prevalence among people with a serious mental
illness was 40.5% according to the Local Tobacco Control Profiles
(https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tobacco-control).
People with a mental health condition are just as likely to want to stop smoking as
those without, but are more likely to be addicted to smoking and more likely to think
it will be difficult to stop smoking.
There is an urgent need to address the widening inequalities which remain from
high smoking rates among this population. If these inequalities are going to be
reduced, it’s essential that smokers in mental health services are routinely
identified and offered evidence-based support, which is based on NICE guidance
PH48 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph48).

9.3 What will you see locally if you are meeting the
principle?
NICE guidance relating to smoking cessation and tobacco control is implemented
fully in all aspects of care for individuals with a mental health condition.
People with a mental health condition are provided with the same, or better,
opportunities to access smoking cessation support services as the general
population.

These services provide outcomes that are comparable to those experienced by the
general population.
Effective links between primary and secondary care provision, resulting in
integrated tobacco dependence treatment pathways.
Providers of mental health services have an excellent understanding of what they
need to do in relation to smoking cessation and smokefree environments
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-preventing-ill-health-fromalcohol-and-tobacco/health-matters-preventing-ill-health-from-alcohol-and-tobacco-use).

Smokefree signage and application of policy is clear and consistent throughout the
estate, with high levels of compliance.
Policies on e-cigarette use make a clear distinction between smoking and vaping,
and support smokers to quit smoking and stay smokefree while managing
identified risks.
Those people who do not want or are unable to stop smoking in one step are
offered other strategies to reduce the harm of tobacco, as outlined in NICE
guidance PH45 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45).

9.4 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Has NICE guidance PH48 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph48), which supports
mental health trusts’ implementation of smokefree policies, been followed and have
staff and patients had an opportunity to voice and overcome their concerns?
Has consultation with appropriate stakeholders, including service user groups,
influenced the design of services?
Do you understand enough about the needs of people with a mental health
condition who smoke to ensure that services are appropriately commissioned?
Do senior clinicians support and champion the process of identification, referral,
intervention and follow-up?
Do all staff in mental health settings receive training on brief interventions for
smoking cessation, and medical and nursing staff receive more extensive training
in smoking cessation?
Are smokefree mental health units an integral part of a health-promoting culture,
providing alternative, meaningful activity during the day?
Are policies on e-cigarette use consistent with PHE advice
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-e-cigarettes-in-public-places-andworkplaces)?

Do specialist cessation services for people with a mental health condition achieve
results comparable with the best services nationally?

Are users of mental health services able to access stop smoking medications?
Are outcomes monitored in such a way as to ensure that they reduce health
inequalities?
Has the NHS trust undertaken a CLeaR deep dive review of smoking in mental
health settings (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-controlassessment) with all relevant partners?

10. Offender health
10.1 Statement of principle
A comprehensive tobacco control strategy provides high quality evidence-based
support to those people who need it most.

10.2 Offenders tend to have poor physical and mental
health and high smoking rates
Nationally around 80% of prisoners smoke compared with 15.5% in the general
population (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoking-in-prisons-managementof-tobacco-use-and-nicotine-withdrawal), with similar levels recorded across the
offender journey in police custody and community supervision where data is
available. See ‘Healthcare issues of detainees in police custody in London, UK’
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20083045).
This high rate of smoking causes health problems to the smokers themselves and
to non-smokers who are exposed to their tobacco smoke. The offender population
has a high prevalence of poor mental health and substance misuse according to
‘Substance misuse among prisoners in England and Wales’
(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0954026021000046092), and offenders are
predominantly from disadvantaged backgrounds (see ‘Health indicators in a prison
population: Asking prisoners’
(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001789690306200406), all of which are
associated with high smoking prevalence. Offenders who smoke and those
exposed to this smoke experience a marked increase in health inequalities.
In September 2015, the Prisons Minister announced the roll-out of smokefree
prisons across England and Wales (https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/smokingin-prisons). Three years later in September 2018, the last few prisons in England
joined the rest of the estate in providing custody within entirely smokefree
environments.
The smokefree prisons estate provides the opportunity for around 200,000 people
each year to experience life free of smoke. For many of these, this will be their first
ever opportunity to do so. Healthcare and prison staff across the estate have
received evidence-based training to support smokers to quit. Nicotine replacement

is available on prescription and electronic cigarettes are available to buy in the
prison canteen.
NHS England published the healthcare service specification ‘Minimum offer for
stop smoking services and support in custody’
(https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/minimum-offer-for-stop-smoking-services-andsupport-in-custody/). All prisons are expected to meet this minimum service offer. It

supports the work programme to reduce smoking in prisons and is aimed at
standardising the approach and quality of smoking cessation services delivered in
prisons. This document defines standards for training, interventions and
pharmacological support for smoking cessation to be adhered to by stop smoking
services in all prisons.

10.3 What you will see if you are meeting the principle
NICE guidance relating to smoking cessation and tobacco control is implemented
fully in all aspects of care for those within the justice system.
People in prison, custody or under community supervision are provided with the
same, or better, opportunities to access stop smoking support services as the
general population.
People in prison, custody or under community supervision report that the services
provided are accessible, suitable and address their specific needs.
Nicotine-containing products including e-cigarettes are available and offered to
smokers entering custody for the first time and their availability is maintained
through the offender pathway.
Staff working within the criminal justice system have a full understanding of what
services they are required to deliver.
People who do not want to or are unable to stop smoking in one step should be
offered other strategies to reduce the harm of tobacco, as outlined in NICE
guidance PH45 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45).

10.4 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Do NHS England Health and Justice
(https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/health-just/) and local authority

commissioners work together to ensure that there are robust arrangements in
place to support people who need smoking cessation services as they move
between custody and the community?
Has NICE public health guidance (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng57) been
followed?
Has consultation with appropriate stakeholders, including groups representing
offenders, influenced the design of services?

Are the needs of people in prison, custody or under community supervision
sufficiently well understood to ensure that services are appropriately
commissioned?
Do governors, senior management and senior clinicians support and champion the
process?
Do all staff in prison, custodial and community settings receive training on brief
interventions for smoking cessation, with medical and nursing staff receiving more
extensive training? This should also include training staff in prison settings, in
particular health providers, listeners and peer supporters.
Are the stop smoking services delivered in line with the ‘Minimum offer for stop
smoking services and support in custody’
(https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/minimum-offer-for-stop-smoking-services-andsupport-in-custody/) document?

Do specialist cessation services for people in prison, custody or under community
supervision achieve results comparable with the best services nationally?
Are outcomes monitored to ensure that they reduce health inequalities?
Do services achieve the desired outcomes?
Are those people who do not want to or are unable to stop smoking in one step
offered other strategies to reduce the harm of tobacco, as outlined in NICE
guidance PH45 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45)?
Are stop smoking services in the community linked to prison-based services to
provide post-release support?

11. Workplace interventions
11.1 Statement of principle
Interventions delivered in workplaces will encourage more people to access
support to stop smoking, reduce absenteeism and increase productivity.

11.2 Workplaces can be important settings for promoting
smoking cessation
Smoking has a significant impact on business productivity. It is estimated that
smoking breaks and smoking-related sick days cost businesses in England around
£6.8 billion a year (http://ash.org.uk/category/information-and-resources/local-resources/).
Reducing levels of smoking among employees will help reduce illnesses and
conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease, which are important
causes of sickness absence. This will result in improved productivity and a reduced
burden on employers and employees.

The workplace has several advantages as a setting for smoking cessation
interventions, including:
large numbers of people can be reached (including groups which may not
normally consult health professionals, such as young men)
the potential to provide peer group support
a non-smoking working environment encourages people who smoke to quit (see
NICE guideline PH5 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph5) and NICE quality
standard QS82 (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs82))

11.3 What you will see if you are meeting the principle
A widely accessible stop smoking service available to all employees.
Employers supporting employees through quit attempts allowing them time off to
attend stop smoking services.
Where demand is identified, stop smoking clinics delivered on site in workplaces.
Smokefree working environments and comprehensive smokefree policies are
consistently enforced.
Policies on e-cigarette use make a clear distinction between smoking and vaping,
and support smokers to quit smoking and stay smokefree while managing
identified risks.

11.4 Questions to check if you are following the evidence
and best practice
Is support for smoking cessation established in local workplace wellbeing initiatives
(https://wellbeing.bitc.org.uk/all-resources/toolkits/drugs-alcohol-and-tobacco-toolkitemployers)?

Is there communication between the stop smoking service and local employers?
Have barriers to accessing stop smoking support from the workplace been
identified?
Are employees routinely provided with information on local stop smoking support
services? Are staff allowed time off to attend stop smoking services?
Do larger employers in the area allow the local stop smoking services to attend
events to offer very brief advice?
Are public sector smoking policies an exemplar to other local employers?
Does your policy facilitate the use of licensed nicotine replacement therapy in the
workplace?

Is your policy on e-cigarette use consistent with PHE advice
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-e-cigarettes-in-public-places-andworkplaces)?

Are all employees protected from secondhand smoke in their workplace, including
those who provide home visits, or visit other workplaces?
Is your smokefree policy regularly reviewed and updated if necessary?

12. Tackling cheap and illicit tobacco
12.1 Statement of principle
The local authority has established partnership arrangements with other local
authorities and external partners which focus on reducing the demand for and the
supply of illicit tobacco.

12.2 Illicit tobacco is a problem which needs local action
The illicit tobacco market (https://www.illicit-tobacco.co.uk/) is in long-term decline but
remains a problem in some communities. It undermines tobacco control measures,
including taxation and age of sale regulations. This can lead to children starting a
lethal addiction and encouraging smokers to smoke more than if they were paying
full price. Criminal activity in the illicit trade tends to target smokers in deprived
areas, further increasing health inequalities.
Effective approaches are co-ordinated across some large geographical areas
where health and enforcement partners collaborate to reduce the demand for and
the supply of illicit tobacco. Evidence-based social marketing and public relations
campaigns have raised awareness of the issue in these areas, helped to generate
intelligence and have provided the facts on illicit tobacco by countering the
misinformation circulated by the tobacco industry.

12.3 What you will see if you are meeting the principle
Full engagement between public health, police regional intelligence units, trading
standards, licensing and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs to improve the
intelligence base.
Active intelligence-led enforcement in the locality, accompanied by
communications to build support in the local community and encourage people to
report perpetrators of illicit tobacco crime.
A greater awareness and understanding of the impact of illicit tobacco among
partner organisations and the general public.
Clear data and intelligence on the levels of demand for illicit tobacco which helps to
target priority communities.

Increased reporting of illicit tobacco by the general public.

12.4 Questions to check if you are following the evidence
and best practice
Have local or regional measures been established to assess the impact of activity,
including quantity of information received from the public, seizures and
enforcement activity, and increased partnership working between agencies?
Have local or regional evaluation surveys been conducted to measure the impact
of activity? Do these include the establishment of a baseline?
Is there a safe, anonymous intelligence-sharing resource available for the public
and partner agencies to use?
Is there a dedicated budget for illicit tobacco enforcement activity and social
marketing activity?
Is there collaboration on illicit tobacco between local areas within the region?
Has a public opinion and stakeholder survey been carried out on illicit tobacco?
Do the local trading standards authorities and police forces recognise tackling illicit
tobacco as a strategic priority (https://www.illicit-tobacco.co.uk/) within broader
tobacco control work?
Is there a local or regional policy in place on the WHO Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control Article 5.3 (http://www.who.int/fctc/guidelines/adopted/article_5_3/en/),
to protect policies from the vested interests of the tobacco industry?

13. Smokefree outdoor spaces
13.1 Statement of principle
Where smokefree outdoor places are introduced, this should happen within an
evidence based approach to tobacco control and with rigorous evaluation.

13.2 There is mixed evidence on the benefits of outdoor
smokefree spaces
The health impacts of outdoor secondhand smoke are contested. Exposure to
secondhand smoke outdoors can be high in some conditions (a high density of
smokers, enclosed outdoor locations, low wind and close proximity to smokers).
There is very limited UK research available about the effectiveness of smokefree
outdoors as they are less widely adopted here than internationally. Evidence from
other countries suggests that levels of support can vary considerably according to
type of place and respondent’s personal characteristics.

Attitudes towards smokefree outdoor places do not necessarily translate into
behaviour change. Compliance can be low, even when a policy is mandatory.
There is some evidence for positive effects on behaviour where some reductions in
smoking prevalence have been seen in student populations following the
introduction of a smokefree campus.
There should be a clear distinction between smoking and vaping. E-cigarettes can
be helpful for abstinence from smoking and could be encouraged in places where
smoking is prohibited.
More evidence is needed. If local smokefree outdoor policies are implemented,
rigorous, peer reviewed evaluations will help to develop this.

13.3 What you will see locally if you are meeting the
principle
Local policies and plans on smokefree outdoor places have clear intended
outcomes and rigorous evaluation in place to see if these outcomes are met.
Where smokefree outdoor spaces are introduced they are within a wider tobacco
control strategy.
There is a clear distinction between policies on smoking and vaping.

13.4 Questions to check if you are following evidence and
best practice
Is your smokefree outdoor policy based on the best available evidence?
Do you have clear outcomes for your smokefree outdoor policy and an evaluation
plan in place to assess if these are met?
Is there a clear distinction between smoking and vaping in your outdoor smokefree
policy?

14. CLeaR model for tobacco control
CLeaR (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-controlassessment) is an evidence-based improvement model that supports local action to
reduce the use of tobacco. The model is designed for use by local authorities,
tobacco alliances and NHS partners. The CLeaR model offers:
1. A free-to-access self-assessment tool that can assist in evaluating the
effectiveness of local action addressing harm from tobacco - a major aspect of
any health and wellbeing strategy.
2. An opportunity to bring local partners together to discuss the range of local
tobacco control efforts and reinforce efforts and priorities.

3. A voluntary peer assessment process, which provides independent challenge to
self-assessments and access to a recognised quality mark.
4. A chance to benchmark work on tobacco over time and against others.
CLeaR was updated in November 2017 to make it more relevant to all partners
working in tobacco control. As part of the work, a series of “deep dive” tools were
developed. These tools follow the same design as the generic CLeaR improvement
tool but, rather than cover the breadth of tobacco control, they focus on specific
issues. They currently cover:
smoking in pregnancy
smoking in acute settings
smoking in mental health settings
A fourth deep dive tool, looking at tackling illegal tobacco, is currently in
development. These deep dives can help localities to focus on topics of particular
challenge, and will support broader NHS efforts on the smokefree agenda, as well
as compliance with the requirements of CQUIN.
A guide to the CLeaR process, along with the self-assessment tool and deep dive
tools, can be found online.
